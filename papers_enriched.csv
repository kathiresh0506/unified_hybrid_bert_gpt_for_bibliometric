Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones.

H. Tay, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan","Transformers, which are popular for language modeling, have been explored for solving vision tasks recently, e.g., the Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global relation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find it is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the important local structure such as edges and lines among neighboring pixels, leading to low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone design of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed computation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vision Transformer (T2T-VTT), which incorporates 1) a layer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize the image to tokens by recursively aggregating neighboring Tokens into one Token (Tokens-to-Token), such that local structure represented by surrounding tokens can be modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an efficient backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision transformer motivated by CNN architecture design after empirical study. Notably, T2T-ViT reduces the parameter count and MACs of vanilla ViT by half, while achieving more than 3.0% improvement when trained from scratch on ImageNet. It also outperforms ResNets and achieves comparable performance with MobileNets by directly training on ImageNet.

Especially when detecting densely packed objects in aerial images, methods relying on horizontal proposals for common object detection often introduce mismatches between the Region of Interests (RoIs) and objects. This leads to the common misalignment between the final object classification confidence and localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a RoI Transformer to address these problems. The core idea of RoI Transformer is to apply spatial transformations on RoIs and learn the transformation parameters under the supervision of oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations. RoI Transformer is with lightweight and can be easily embedded into detectors for oriented object detection. Simply apply the RoI Transformer to light head RCNN has achieved state-of-the-art performances on two common and challenging aerial datasets, i.e., DOTA and HRSC2016, with a neglectable reduction to detection speed. Our RoI Transformer exceeds the deformable Position Sensitive RoI pooling when oriented bounding-box annotations are available. Extensive experiments have also validated the flexibility and effectiveness of our RoI Transformer.",False,,object detection in aerial images is an active yet challenging task in computer vision because of the birdseye view perspective the highly complex backgrounds and the variant appearances of objects especially when detecting densely packed objects in aerial images methods relying on horizontal proposals for common object detection often introduce mismatches between the region of interests rois and objects this leads to the common misalignment between the final object classification confidence and localization accuracy in this paper we propose a roi transformer to address these problems the core idea of roi transformer is to apply spatial transformations on rois and learn the transformation parameters under the supervision of oriented bounding box obb annotations roi transformer is with lightweight and can be easily embedded into detectors for oriented object detection simply apply the roi transformer to light head rcnn has achieved stateoftheart performances on two common and challenging aerial datasets ie dota and hrsc2016 with a neglectable reduction to detection speed our roi transformer exceeds the deformable position sensitive roi pooling when oriented boundingbox annotations are available extensive experiments have also validated the flexibility and effectiveness of our roi transformer,[],[]

We repurpose a Transformer-style architecture to aggregate features from the spatiotemporal context around the person whose actions we are trying to classify. We show that by using high-resolution, person-specific, class-agnostic queries, the model spontaneously learns to track individual people and to pick up on semantic context from the actions of others. Additionally its attention mechanism learns to emphasize hands and faces, which are often crucial to discriminate an action - all without explicit supervision other than boxes and class labels. We train and test our Action Transformer network on the Atomic Visual Actions (AVA) dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art by a significant margin using only raw RGB frames as input.",True,,we introduce the action transformer model for recognizing and localizing human actions in video clips we repurpose a transformerstyle architecture to aggregate features from the spatiotemporal context around the person whose actions we are trying to classify we show that by using highresolution personspecific classagnostic queries the model spontaneously learns to track individual people and to pick up on semantic context from the actions of others additionally its attention mechanism learns to emphasize hands and faces which are often crucial to discriminate an action  all without explicit supervision other than boxes and class labels we train and test our action transformer network on the atomic visual actions ava dataset outperforming the stateoftheart by a significant margin using only raw rgb frames as input,[],[]

Long,"A comprehensive review of the electrical performance of passive transformers fabricated in silicon IC technology is presented. Two types of transformer construction are considered in detail, and the characteristics of two-port (1:1 and 1:n turns ratio) and multiport transformers (i.e., baluns) are presented from both computer simulation and experimental measurements. The effects of parasitics and imperfect coupling between transformer windings are outlined from the circuit point of view. Resonant tuning is shown to reduce the losses between input and output at the expense of operating bandwidth. A procedure for estimating the size of a monolithic transformer to meet a given specification is outlined, and circuit examples are used to illustrate the applications of the monolithic transformer in RF ICs.",False,,a comprehensive review of the electrical performance of passive transformers fabricated in silicon ic technology is presented two types of transformer construction are considered in detail and the characteristics of twoport 11 and 1n turns ratio and multiport transformers ie baluns are presented from both computer simulation and experimental measurements the effects of parasitics and imperfect coupling between transformer windings are outlined from the circuit point of view resonant tuning is shown to reduce the losses between input and output at the expense of operating bandwidth a procedure for estimating the size of a monolithic transformer to meet a given specification is outlined and circuit examples are used to illustrate the applications of the monolithic transformer in rf ics,[],[]
