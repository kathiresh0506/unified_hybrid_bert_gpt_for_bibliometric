Abstract
Incident management is a classical topic in cyber security. Recently, the European Union (EU) has started to consider
also the relation between cyber security incidents and cyber security crises. These considerations and preparations,
including those specified in the EU’s new cyber security laws, constitute the paper’s topic. According to an analysis of
the laws and associated policy documents, (i) cyber security crises are equated in the EU to large-scale cyber security
incidents that either exceed a handling capacity of a single member state or affect at least two member states. For this
and other purposes, (ii) the new laws substantially increase mandatory reporting about cyber security incidents, including
but not limited to the large-scale incidents. Despite the laws and new governance bodies established by them, however,
(iii) the working of actual cyber security crisis management remains unclear particularly at the EU-level. With these
policy research results, the paper advances the domain of cyber security incident management research by elaborating
how European law perceives cyber security crises and their relation to cyber security incidents, paving the way for many
relevant further research topics with practical relevance, whether theoretical, conceptual, or empirical.
Keywords: risk management, risk analysis, incident management, crisis management, regulations, governance, EU
1. Introduction
“Europe has been in crisis management mode for a
decade and a half” (Handler, 2024, p. 1). Although the
statement quoted is true in many respects, it does not
(yet) apply to the cyber security domain. In other words,
to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has not been a
truly large-scale, pan-European cyber security crisis thus
far. This statement does not mean that the EU would
not have prepared for such a crisis. These preparations,
including those mandated by the EU’s new cyber security
laws, are what the paper is about. The paper’s relevance
and contributions can be elaborated with four brief points.
To start from practical relevance, first, the topic is
timely. In fact, the European Commission (EC) just re-
cently released a new proposal for handling large-scale,
cross-country cyber security crises in Europe (EC, 2025a).
The second point follows from this timeliness; again to
the best of the authors’ knowledge, the paper is the first
to elaborate cyber security crisis management in the EU
context. While there are some existing works, they have
concentrated on national cyber security crisis manage-
ment (Boeke, 2017; Collier, 2016; Østby and Katt, 2020).
That is, the EU context has been missing thus far, includ-
ing with respect to the EU’s new judicial framework. In

received limited attention in general (B´ eland et al., 2024).
Subsequently, third, the paper contributes to the recent ef-
forts to digest and analyze the EU’s many new cyber secu-
rity laws and their implications (Alexopoulos et al., 2025;
Busetti and Scanni, 2025; Mueck and Gaie, 2025; Rataj,
2025; Ruohonen, 2024b; Ruohonen et al., 2025, among
many others). Regarding existing research and knowledge
more generally, fourth and last, the paper contributes to
the incident management research domain by elaborating,
analyzing, and theorizing on how incidents are related to
and may transform into crises. Because crises typically
have immense consequences, the paper’s overall relevance
is well-justified; it is important to understand how the
EU’s new cyber security legal framework is designed with
crisis management in mind.
With respect to the last point, both incident manage-
ment research and frameworks for it have traditionally op-
erated at the organizational level; incidents are something
that organizations may face, and thus they should also pre-
pare for them. For instance, a classical incident manage-
ment framework from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) defines cyber security incident as
“a violation or imminent threat of violation” of any cy-
ber “security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard
security practices” established and enforced by organiza-
tions (Cichonski et al., 2012, p. 6). The organizational fo-
cus is thus clear. According to an early literature review,
Preprint submitted to Elsevier April 22, 2025arXiv:2504.14220v1  [cs.CR]  19 Apr 2025
a similar focus is present in many other well-known frame-
works and standards for incident management and closely
related topics (Tøndel et al., 2014). From the previous
quotation it also follows that an organization should have
cyber security policies established and enforced because
otherwise an incident remains only implicit and vaguely
defined. A similar claim applies to cyber security crisis
management; also larger entities, whether industry sec-
tors, geographic regions, or countries and beyond, should
have policies in place for handling cyber security crises.
As will be seen, in the EU these policies are partially but
still explicitly written in recent cyber security laws.
A further point about the organizational focus is that it
has typically been present also in different socio-technical
frameworks for incident management and cyber security
management in general (Al Sabbagh and Kowalski, 2015;
Jaatun et al., 2009; van Haastrecht et al., 2021). Moti-
vated by a recent work on layered cyber security frame-
works (Panteli et al., 2025), the paper adopts a multi-level
perspective sometimes used in the socio-technical frame-
works (Malatji et al., 2019), but extends it beyond orga-
nizations. Thus, the first part in the socio-technical term
refers to an adjective societal and particularly a noun Eu-
ropean. Although societal cyber security is not a well-
defined concept, it has sometimes been discussed in a con-
text of critical infrastructure protection (Gjesvik, 2019).
Such a framing serves also the paper’s purposes well be-
cause among the EU laws considered is an important new
law for critical infrastructure protection in Europe.
With these motivating remarks in mind, the following
three research questions (RQs) are examined:
•RQ.1: What constitutes a cyber security crisis in the
European Union?
•RQ.2: What do recent EU laws impose upon cyber
security incident and crisis management?
•RQ.3: How cyber security crises are managed, gov-
erned, and coordinated in the EU and by whom?
The paper’s remainder is structured into four sections.
The opening Section 2 motivates the background further,
including with respect to the multi-level approach pursued
and the EU laws considered. The methodology for analyz-
ing these is also elaborated, and a few clarifying framings
are also done to restrict and limit the paper’s scope. Sec-
tion 3 continues by elaborating how different law-imposed
incident types are related to the multi-level approach. In
general, the section answers to RQ.1 and RQ.2. The sub-
sequent Section 4 answers to RQ.3 by elaborating the var-
ious institutions, organizations, and networks involved in
cyber security crisis management in the EU context. The
final Section 5 presents a concluding discussion.2. Background
2.1. Framings
Some framings are required for limiting and aligning
the paper’s scope to a manageable composition. To be-
gin with, the paper is framed toward cyber security alone.
The paper’s opening quotation about Europe having been
in a crisis management mode for a long time helps to un-
derstand that crises vary a lot; from financial crises all
the way to wars and the existential climate change crisis.
While notions such as cascading effects and risks (Adkins
et al., 2020; Ruohonen, 2024a; Ruohonen et al., 2025) make
it understandable that many crises may be interconnected
to each other, no attempts are made to connect cyber se-
curity crises to other crises. The same applies regarding
threats. Some cyber security threats, including particu-
larly those related to advanced persistent threat (APT) ac-
tors, are today, in Europe, often perceived to be linked
with a broader class of so-called hybrid threats (Anagnos-
takis, 2023; Jungwirth et al., 2023). While acknowledging
the linkage’s theoretical and practical validity, no attempts
are made to move beyond plain cyber security. By implica-
tion, as hybrid threats may involve also a military dimen-
sion, also the EU’s other cyber security pillars (Christou,
2016; Ruohonen, 2024b), whether cyber defense or data
protection, are excluded from the paper’s scope. Further-
more, theorizing about different types of cyber security
crises are further omitted for brevity, clarity, and align-
ment with the EU’s laws.
With respect to large-scale cyber security crises, ENISA
(2024, p. 12) emphasizes a need to distinguish between a
creeping crisis, “which simmers under the radar” before
“suddenly and unexpectedly erupting”, an acute crisis,
“which is sudden, unforeseen and can have a massive im-
pact in a very short amount of time”, and a recurring cri-
sis, which occurs almost continuously. Similar categoriza-
tions have been presented in the academic literature (Boin
et al., 2018; Head, 2022). Of these three types, denial of
service attacks, in particular, could be seen as something
recurrent, whereas a severe data breach or a successful
ransomware attack might be seen to belong to the cate-
gory of acute crises. Though, these examples are more
about incidents than crises; therefore, also risk analysis is
presumably more challenging when trying to assess crises
rater than incidents; when operating at a level of societies
or beyond rather than at the conventional organizational
level. At the societal level, an example of a creeping crisis
might involve a discovered large-scale espionage campaign
conducted by an APT actor. Beyond these brief remarks,
as said, more elaborate theorization is left for further work.
2.2. Methodology
The paper operates in the domain of policy studies.
Within this domain, a separation between policy analysis
and policy (process) research is sometimes done. Broadly
2
speaking, the former is about prescriptive research seek-
ing to inform policy-making, whether in terms of evalua-
tions, impact assessments, or something else, while the lat-
ter is descriptive research focused particularly on theory-
building (DeLeon and Weible, 2010; Secchi, 2016). Given
this characterization, the paper is about policy research.
Regarding descriptive policy research, an ex post ,post hoc ,
or retrospective approach is used (cf. Patton et al., 2016).
This choice is also unavoidable because the EU laws con-
sidered have already been enacted.
Regarding ex ante policy analysis, it is worth remarking
that the EC did prior impact assessments for most—but
not all (EP, 2024)—of the laws considered in the paper.
For the paper’s purposes, it is particularly worth remark-
ing that these assessments indicated a lack of joint situa-
tional awareness and crisis management between the mem-
ber states, and between them and the EU-level administra-
tion; information sharing was concluded to operate on an
ad hoc basis and cross-border spillovers were omitted from
risk analyses (EC, 2020, pp. 21–22). This point justifies an
academic expert evaluation of the three RQs postulated.
Regarding theory-building, the paper analyzes and the-
orizes how the EU’s new laws align with common analyt-
ical frameworks used in incident and crisis management
research. On the side of engineering and computer sci-
ence, within which theory-building often has a different
meaning, the paper aligns with requirements engineering
research within which legal requirements are a distinct
genre (Ruohonen et al., 2025). This research branch jus-
tifies RQ.2. In other words, it is important to know what
laws require, whether from organizations, producers, or
public administrations. Once an answer is known, it is pos-
sible to continue toward empirical policy research; with-
out knowing the legal requirements, formulation of rele-
vant research questions is difficult—if not questionable al-
together. This point also applies to the framings done; in-
sofar as policy analysis is concerned, it is pointless to eval-
uate responses to hybrid threats without knowing about
the preparations and frameworks for handling them.
2.3. Analytical Levels
The paper’s conceptual and theoretical background can
be motivated by considering an analytical relation be-
tween incidents and crisis through different vertical levels
of analysis often used in social sciences. A term multi-
level analysis is sometimes used to refer to approaches
that operate at two or more such levels (B´ eland et al.,
2024; Hutzschenreuter et al., 2020). The term should not
be equated to multi-level (cyber) security, although there
is a rough conceptual similarity because both involve a hi-
erarchy (Anderson, 2020). In any case, an incident that
involves multiple analytical levels could be called a multi-
level incident—or, depending on which levels an incident
has transcended, a cyber security crisis.2.3.1. The International Level
The international level is at the top of the hierarchy.
When operating at this level, an analysis typically func-
tions horizontally, focusing on relations between states. In
terms of cyber security, good examples about such inter-
state, transnational relations would cover cyber norms, cy-
ber diplomacy, and even what is known and debated as
cyber war. However, as said, such topics are beyond the
paper’s scope. Another point is that it is also possible
to consider information systems and other technical solu-
tions at this level; such systems and solutions are those
that transcend both national and organizational bound-
aries (Rukanova et al., 2015). Such transcendence can also
been seen as something that separates cyber security inci-
dents from cyber security crises.
If a cyber security incident escalates to the international
level, it is not really any more a mere incident but rather
a crisis. With this point in mind, Fig. 1 displays seven an-
alytical levels through which incidents may become crises.
As can be seen, the impact is taken to increase the further
a cyber security event is from an incident.

2.3.2. The Supranational Level
Below the international level is a supranational level.
This level is at which the EU operates; the European
Union is a supranational union. At the same time, how-
ever, it operates in intergovernmental terms; the Council
of the European Union would be the prime example in this
regard. In contrast, the European Union Agency for Cy-
bersecurity (ENISA) operates at the supranational level,
although intergovernmental tenets may still be present in
terms of staffing and related aspects. While there is a
classical debate regarding the meaning of and interplay be-
tween these two theoretical governance terms (Bickerton
et al., 2022; Handler, 2024; Tsebelis and Garrett, 2021),
without a particular loss of specificity and rigor, the term
supranationalism is used in case there is no particular rea-
son to emphasize the intergovernmental dimension.
Note also a difference between the terms transnational
and intergovernmental; the latter is about relations be-
tween governments, as is the case in the Council in which
ministers or other heads of states represent their mem-
3
ber states, whereas the former can be seen to cover also
supranational governance because the meaning is essen-
tially about relations between nations. These relations
may be about states, but they may also include transna-
tional non-governmental organizations, different transna-
tional collaboration and coordination networks, and inter-
national organizations (G¨ anzle et al., 2022). When such
transnational relations are accounted for, the term multi-
level governance can be seen to cover also a horizontal
dimension; a coordination and collaboration between dif-
ferent entities not directly linked to governmental repre-
sentatives. These terminological clarifications are impor-
tant because the EU’s overall multi-level crisis manage-
ment framework covers numerous actors operating at dif-
ferent governance levels and policy areas (Anagnostakis,
2023). The concepts also provide a theoretical foundation
for analyzing the EU’s cyber security crisis management
framework in terms of governance and coordination.
2.3.3. The National, Regional, and Sectoral Levels
When taking a step downwards from the supranational
level, the national level is encountered. Regarding gover-
nance, authoritative computer security incident response
teams (CSIRTs) are particularly relevant in Europe; ac-
cording to both old and new EU laws, each member state
should have an authoritative CSIRT or a related com-
petent authority for nationwide incident management.1
However, presently it remains still somewhat unclear how
national administrations are, or will be, arranged in each
and every member state. By hypothesis, the divergence is,
or will be, large across the twenty-seven member states.
Although there are no clear demarcations, operations at
the national level are sometimes (but not always) about
crisis management rather than incident management. The
same could be said even about the regional level, espe-
cially when keeping in mind that it includes both smaller
geographically bound administrative units as well as larger
geographic units, such as is the case in the Germany’s fed-
eralist administration. Also crisis management tends to
be decentralized to the regional, L¨ ander , level in Germany,
although strategic management and high-level political co-
ordination occurs at the federal level (Christensen et al.,
2016). Without the federalist twist, the setup is rather
similar to many other European countries within which
strategic and political aspects are oftentimes centralized,
while the operational level is often more or less decen-
tralized (Christensen et al., 2016; Gjesvik, 2019; Ramsell
and Wihlborg, 2012). Regions also intervene with indus-
try sectors in many member states. Whether an exam-
ple is about the Ruhr region in Germany or the Emilia-
Romagna region in Italy, specialized industry activity has
1Here, the adjective authoritative is used for emphasizing a dif-
ference to other CSIRTs, including sectoral teams as well as teams
within organizations and companies. Note also that in practice the
abbreviation CSIRT is equivalent to an abbreviation CERT, denot-
ing a computer emergency response team.often concentrated to specific regions in Europe and also
elsewhere. Authoritative CSIRTs in some European coun-
tries have also been decentralized with sectoral special-
ization in mind (Boin et al., 2018). In terms of incident
management, many industries also have different sectoral
and regional coordination networks and governance hubs.
2.3.4. The Organizational and Individual Levels
Then, below the sectoral level is the organizational
level. As said in the introduction, this level has been
the traditional focal point in incident management and
its research. Again, coordination may occur horizon-
tally between organizations (inter-organizational coordi-
nation) and within organizations (intra-organizational co-
ordination), and vertically between organizations and in-
dividuals (Heine, 2019; Panteli et al., 2025). The intra-
organizational coordination is relevant also for establish-
ing organizational CSIRTs; typical choices for large orga-
nizations include outsourcing, a centralized organization-
wide team, or distributed teams across an organization’s
departments (Mitropoulos et al., 2006; Cichonski et al.,
2012). Organizations may also coordinate vertically with
sectoral or regional entities, such as industry associations,
as well as entities operating at a national level, including
authoritative CSIRTs in particular. Finally, as seen from
Fig. 1, it is also possible to consider incidents at a level
of individuals, whether employees, citizens, or consumers.
Given the extensive research and evidence on the human
factors in cyber security, it is also possible that an incident
affecting an individual escalates to the organizational level
or even beyond that.
2.3.5. An Example of a Multi-Level Incident
A good example about a multi-level incident would be
the attacks against Danish energy sector companies in
2023. Given that over twenty energy sector companies
were compromised, the incident prompted also interna-
tional media attention (Antoniuk, 2023). Regarding the
analytical levels, the example is illuminating because it
involved three or four levels in Fig. 1.
To begin with, the incident was not only organizational
but also sectoral due to the involvement of multiple com-
panies in the same sector. Given the potential concen-
tration of the energy sector companies to some particular
regions in Denmark, the incident could be perhaps inter-
preted to involve also the regional level. In any case, the
sectoral level manifested itself also in the investigation con-
ducted by SektorCERT (2023), a non-profit CSIRT com-
posed by Danish critical infrastructure companies and op-
erators. The investigation revealed that the compromises
were conducted by exploiting a vulnerability in a firewall
product.2Furthermore, an update had been available but
the energy sector companies had not patched their firewalls
for a reason or another. During the incident management,
the issue escalated further to the national level.
2CVE-2023-28771.

Among other things, CFCS (2023), the authoritative
CSIRT in Denmark, raised the threat level against the
Danish energy sector to the very high level category. How-
ever: while multiple levels were involved, the incident is
not yet something that could be interpreted as a cyber se-
curity crisis according to the EU’s laws. This point will
become clear in Subsection 3.1 that elaborates different
incident types present in the recently enacted EU laws.
2.4. The EU’s Strategy
The EU’s new cyber security strategy can be sum-
marized in the form of Fig. 2. Three of the strategy’s
pillars—prevention, detection, and response—resemble
rather similar phases in incident management frameworks.
For instance, the NIST’s noted framework is structured
around preparation, detection and analysis, containment,
eradication, and recovery, and post-incident phases (Ci-
chonski et al. 2012; cf. also Mitropoulos et al. 2006).
Rather analogously, ENISA (2024) builds upon preven-
tion, preparedness, and response and recovery phases. An-
other example would be prepare, detect and recover, and
learn (Jaatun et al., 2009). A further point is that the
EU’s strategy is structured around specific laws, which
are also supported by funding instruments, education, re-
search, development, and innovation projects, and specific
governance bodies, some of which are new.

Figure 2: The EU’s Current Cyber Security Strategy in a Nutshell
(adopted from EC 2025b)
Before continuing to enumerate the laws covered, it
should be emphasized that there are many further EU laws
explicitly or implicitly related to cyber security, some of
which are sector-specific and some others of which over-
lap with each other (EC, 2025a; Fischer-H¨ ubner et al.,
2021; Ruohonen et al., 2025). Against this backdrop, it is
no wonder that regulatory fragmentation and complexity
have been a source of commonly expressed criticism (Alex-
opoulos et al., 2025; Ruohonen, 2024b). In any case, it
should be emphasized that the specific laws considered
are particularly relevant for the paper’s topic. In other
words, as will elaborated in Section 3, the laws also help
to understand how a transcendence from an incident to a
unionwide crisis is legally perceived and structured.
Of the four laws abbreviated in Fig. 2, particularly im-
portant are the so-called NIS2 directive (EU, 2022) and
the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) regulation (EU, 2024).Although a concept of essential and important entities
(EAIEs) is used in the NIS2 directive, the directive is es-
sentially about critical infrastructure protection. Overall,
the directive builds upon a sectoral approach; numerous
sectors are enumerated as carrying “critical societal or eco-
nomic activities”, to quote from the NIS2’s Article 2(2)(b).
This quotation aligns with the notion of societal cyber se-
curity noted in the introduction. The actual sectors spec-
ified range from traditional critical infrastructure sectors,
such as energy and transport, to banking, healthcare, fi-
nance, drinking and waste water management, the Inter-
net’s core infrastructure, and space technologies.
In contrast, the CRA regulation is a product-specific
law; among other things, it specifies so-called essential cy-
ber security requirements for almost all information tech-
nology products. As these requirements have already been
considered in detail (Ruohonen et al., 2025), including
with respect to new obligations regarding vulnerability co-
ordination and disclosure (Ruohonen and Timmers, 2024),
in what follows, the CRA is only discussed with respect to
its mandates for incident reporting. Having said that, it
is worth remarking that the CRA’s essential requirement
about preferably automated security updates would have
prevented the Danish energy sector case noted earlier in
Subsection 2.3.5, and, furthermore, some of the essential
requirements contain also elements aligning with the tech-
nical detection and prevention of incidents.
Regarding the CRA more generally, also the older Cy-
bersecurity Act (CSA) can be mentioned (EU, 2019).
While it strengthened the role and mandates of ENISA,
it also introduce a common cyber security certification
scheme for information technology products. This certi-
fication scheme aligns with the CRA in that conformance
can be attained also (but not only) through certification.
Given that standards are also an important part of the
CRA and compliance with it, the regulation seems to have
at least partially answered to criticism from the industry
and practitioners (Fischer-H¨ ubner et al., 2021). Finally,
recently a new Cyber Solidarity Act (CSOA) regulation
was agreed upon (EU, 2025). As can be seen from Fig. 2,
it covers aspects from all the three pillars noted earlier.
A couple of additional remarks are in order before con-
tinuing to elaborate the laws and their implications in de-
tail. The first remark is that deterring of cyber security
threats appears in Fig. 2. While this topic is beyond the
paper’s scope, it can be noted that deterrence has long
been debated in the literature (Goodman, 2010, among
many others), some authors having taken a critical stance
about the working of deterrence in the cyber security con-
text (among them Soesanto and Smeets, 2021). The sec-
ond remark is that all of the laws are more or less risk-
based, some explicitly and some only implicitly. In partic-
ular, the NIS2 directive’s Article 21 obliges EAIEs to carry
out comprehensive risk analyses. These should be done by
following a so-called “all-hazards” approach, which is also
familiar from the academic literature (Ayyub et al., 2007;
Izumi, 2024). According to NIS2, the approach means that
5
anything and everything from incident handling, backups,
and supply-chain security to security awareness campaigns
and business continuity should be assessed. The CRA too
is a risk-based regulation; the essential cyber security re-
quirements should be prioritized, designed, implemented
against particular, product-specific risks identified.
3. Incident Types
3.1. Events
Events, including alerts, whether from intrusion detec-
tion systems, other monitoring systems, or somewhere
else, are important building blocks for incident manage-
ment (Cichonski et al., 2012). These also allow under-
standing how incidents may transform into crises accord-
ing to the EU’s jurisprudence. Thus, Fig. 3 displays the
core event types in the new EU laws. The figure can be
elaborated by moving from the bottom to the top, from
alerts to incidents, severe incidents, and beyond. In line
with the previous discussion, at least the last incident type
shown is analytically already on the side of crises.

Figure 3: An Event Type Hierarchy
As was remarked in Subsection 2.4, the CRA’s essen-
tial cyber security requirements for products contain el-
ements that may (or should) foster the detection cyber
security incidents. For instance, the requirements include
a monitoring functionality for a product’s internal activ-
ity, including with respect to authorizations and integrity
guarantees (Ruohonen et al., 2025). In addition, as seen
also from the earlier Fig. 2, the CSOA regulation is rele-
vant too with respect to incident detection. In particular,
the regulation envisions a development of a large-scale,
pan-European network of cyber security alert systems for
coordinated incident detection and improved situational
awareness capabilities. While these systems are labeled as
“cyber hubs” in the regulation, they are essentially what
security operation centers (SOCs) and threat intelligence
systems in general are about. The network is planned
upon voluntary pooling of national alert systems into large
cross-border systems. The national systems may include
not only those maintained by authoritative CSIRTs but
also those operated by private sector companies.3.1.1. Near Misses
An alert can be a false positive or a true positive. Al-
though the NIST’s definition noted in the introduction
covers both, for the present purposes, it makes sense to
frame incidents only toward true positives. Regarding false
positives, the EU’s recent laws introduce a concept of near
misses. A near miss is defined in the NIS2’s Article 6(5)
to mean “an event that could have compromised the avail-
ability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of stored,
transmitted or processed data or of the services offered
by, or accessible via, network and information systems,
but that was successfully prevented”. Thus, within the
context of incident management, the concept can be seen
to be about false positives; about alerts that were suc-
cessfully prevented from becoming actual incidents (true
positives). In any case, reporting about near misses is vol-
untary. According to Article 15(2) in the CRA regulation,
manufacturers and other parties, whether natural or le-
gal persons, may voluntarily report near misses either to
a national authoritative CSIRT or ENISA. Likewise, ac-
cording to Article 30 in the NIS2 directive, EAIEs may
voluntary report near misses to a authoritative CSIRT or
some related public sector authority.
Voluntary reporting seems sensible already due to over-
head and related reasons. Because alerts are voluminous
due to various monitoring systems deployed by organiza-
tions, most of them are false positives, and interoperability
is a typical issue with the monitoring systems and their re-
porting formats (Alahmadi et al., 2022; Zibak et al., 2022).
Analogously to abuse reporting in the Internet (Jhaveri
et al., 2017), a signal to noise ratio is often also low.
Against these backdrops, a mandatory reporting of near
misses would have presumably required large financial in-
vestments and considerable coordination between various
stakeholders involved, including the authoritative Euro-
pean CSIRTs and producers of cyber security monitoring
solutions. The issues with false positives in the cyber secu-
rity context are well-recognized in the literature also more
generally; not only is a minimization of them generally
difficult but also a cost of handling them is often signifi-
cant (Bhatt et al., 2014). However, the EU laws do not say
anything how organizations should actually demarcate be-
tween false and true positives, and whether there are any
consequences from accidentally reporting a false positive
as a true positive or the other way around.
3.1.2. Incidents
Also reporting of most (but not all) true positives—that
is, according to the terminology adopted, incidents—is vol-
untary. According to the NIS2’s Article 6(6), an incident
is defined as “an event compromising the availability, au-
thenticity, integrity or confidentiality of stored, transmit-
ted or processed data or of the services offered by, or acces-
sible via, network and information systems”. When com-
pared to the earlier definition for near misses, an incident
is thus something that has actually compromised data or
6
services. While the definition aligns with classical fram-
ings (Brownlee and Guttman, 1998), there is a difference
to the NIST’s definition noted in the introduction is also
present. Although availability, authenticity, integrity, and
confidentiality may well belong to an organization’s cyber
security policy, the NIS2 only notes, in Article 24, cyber
security policies with respect to open source software asso-
ciations. In any case, according to the NIS2’s Article 30,
reporting of these “conventional” incidents is voluntary.
3.1.3. Severe Incidents
When moving a step upward in the event hierarchy
(see Fig. 3), the CRA regulation (but not the NIS2 direc-
tive) uses a concept of severe incidents. It is mandatory
to report such incidents to both a national authoritative
CSIRT and ENISA according to the CRA’s Article 14(3).
A twofold definition for severe incidents is given in the reg-
ulation’s Article 14(5). The first part emphasizes negative
impacts andpotential negative impacts upon a product’s
ability to protect the availability, authenticity, integrity,
or confidentiality of data or services, whereas the second
part emphasizes an execution and a potential execution
of malicious code. It remains to be seen how manufac-
turers will interpret the demarcation between the impacts
and executions on one hand and the potential impacts and
executions on the other hand.
Another important point is that the CRA is about man-
ufacturers of information technology products, not about
operators of such products, including EAIEs covered by
the NIS2 directive. With some relaxations, manufacturers
are also mandated to report about actively exploited vul-
nerabilities (Ruohonen and Timmers, 2024). In any case,
the divergence between the scopes of the two EU laws
reiterates a criticism expressed in the literature about a
lack of an explicit legal synchronization between different
reporting obligations imposed by different laws (Fischer-
H¨ ubner et al., 2021; Ruohonen, 2024a). In particular, in
case a manufacturer reports to a national authoritative
CSIRT and ENISA about a severe incident, either the
given CSIRT or ENISA, or both, should presumably con-
sequently report to all EAIEs and others using the man-
ufacturer’s given product to which the severe incident ap-
plies. Again, it remains to be seen how such consecutive
reporting will work in practice.
3.1.4. Significant Incidents
The remaining two incident types are specified in the
NIS2 directive. According to the directive’s Article 23(3),
a significant incident either “has caused or is capable of
causing severe operational disruption of the services or fi-
nancial loss for the entity concerned”, or it “has affected
or is capable of affecting other natural or legal persons by
causing considerable material or non-material damage”.
The again twofold definition warrants three brief remarks.
The first remark is related to the earlier point about
potential effects; the wording “capable of” yet again en-
tails a demarcation problem between actual significant in-cidents and those merely conveying a probability of such
incidents. Presently, no guidance is available upon this
demarcation (Busetti and Scanni, 2025). The second re-
mark is related to the wording about “severe operational
disruption”. Here, it would seem that anything from se-
vere denial of service attacks to severe ransomware attacks
are in the scope. The definition’s emphasis of severe finan-
cial losses further underlines ransomware attacks, although
also other so-called destructive cyber attacks are likely in
the NIS2’s scope. The third remark is about the empha-
sis about “considerable material or non-material damage”
to natural persons. Therefore, it has been suspected that
also severe personal data breaches are in the directive’s
scope (Ruohonen et al., 2025), but a definite conclusion
can likely be given only after guidelines have been released
or enforcement has occurred. While keeping these and
other potential interpretation issues in mind, EAIEs must
report about significant incidents to a national authorita-
tive CSIRTs or, where applicable, other public authorities,
as well as other entities concerned according to the NIS2’s
Article 23(1). Thus, broadly speaking, unlike “conven-
tional” incidents, significant incidents fall into a category
of mandatory reporting by EAIEs.
3.1.5. Large-Scale Incidents
Finally, there is the notion about large-scale cyber se-
curity incidents. A large-scale incident is defined in the
NIS2 directive’s Article 6(7) as an incident which either
(a) exceeds a handling capacity of a single member state
or which (b) has a significant impact on at least two mem-
ber states. Regarding incident management frameworks,
the first part of the definition resembles a concept of esca-
lation at the organizational level; an organizational CSIRT
or some related security team cannot get an incident under
control on its own (cf. Jaatun et al., 2009). Another point
is that the EC’s (2025a, p. 12) noted recent proposal clar-
ifies that these large-scale incidents are what is meant by
a cyber security crisis in the EU context. While keeping
the earlier remarks about terminology in mind, a cyber
security crisis is thus something that moves from the na-
tional level to the supranational level in Fig. 1. Also the
NIS2’s recital 69 clarifies this point by noting that large-
scale incidents “may escalate and turn into fully-fledged
crises”. Despite such an escalation potential and interest-
ingly enough, NIS2 does not explicitly say about reporting
obligations of large-scale incidents, but because these must
be something that also satisfy the definition for significant
incidents, reporting can be interpreted as mandatory.
The CSOA’s cyber security alert systems noted in Sub-
section 3.1 are also related to large-scale cyber security
incidents. According to the regulation’s Article 7, partic-
ularly the envisioned cross-border alert systems are seen
as relevant for detecting large-scale incidents and shar-
ing information about them. There are also a couple of
other important points to make about the relation between
large-scale incidents and the CSOA regulation.
The first point is about the exceeding of a member
7
state’s handling capacity used in the definition for a large-
scale cyber security incident. Here, the CSOA’s Article 14
specifies an establishment of a specific cyber security “re-
serve” for handling large-scale incidents. The reserve is
composed by national public sector representatives as well
as other trusted parties. According to Article 15, a mem-
ber state in need may then request help from the reserve
to recover from both significant and large-scale cyber secu-
rity incidents. Furthermore, the CSOA’s Article 19 spec-
ifies that help can be requested also by countries outside
of the EU, provided that they are taking part in the EU’s
Digital Europe Programme (DEP), a funding instrument
for digital technologies and digitalization in general.
The second point is that the CSOA specifies a new cyber
security incident review mechanism. Its scope is restricted
to significant and large-scale incidents. ENISA and a net-
work of authoritative CSIRT are specified as the respon-
sible parties for the actual reviews according to the regu-
lation’s Article 21(1). In line with the post-incident activ-
ities in the NIST’s incident management framework (Ci-
chonski et al., 2012), the reviews are used for improving the
union’s and the member states’ cyber security practices.
Despite an incident’s or a crisis’ negative consequences,
there is always also something to learn from them.
3.2. Deadlines
There are strict deadlines for incidents that are manda-
tory to report. When comparing the CRA’s Article 14
and the NIS2 directive’s Article 23, the wordings about
the deadlines are not verbatim similar but their meaning
is more or less the same. For this reason, the deadlines
can be summarized in the form of Fig. 4. As was noted
in the preceding Subsection 3.1.5, the deadlines for report-
ing about large-scale incidents are implicit but follow from
their inevitable connection to significant incidents. An-
other clarifying remark needed is that the CRA’s notion
about actively exploited vulnerabilities is not about inci-
dents per se but can be discussed alongside them because
the reporting deadlines are similar.

Figure 4: Reporting Deadlines for Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities
and Severe, Significant, and, by implication, Large-Scale Incidents
Thus, severe, significant, and large-scale incidents
should be initially reported to an authoritative CSIRT,
or some other competent authority, no later than twenty-
four hours after becoming aware of them. Then, a more
detailed incident report should be delivered no later thanseventy-two hours after becoming aware of a given inci-
dent. The report delivered should include an initial as-
sessment about a given incident, including its severity and
impact, as well as, where applicable, any indicators of a
compromise. After these two reports, an authoritative
CSIRT may request status updates at any time. A final
report should be delivered within a month. In addition
to severity and impact, the final report should contain a
root cause analysis, any applied and ongoing mitigation
measures, and, where applicable, an assessment about any
cross-border impacts. The cross-border impact assessment
again signifies the relation to large-scale incidents. Re-
garding actively exploited vulnerabilities, the CRA’s Arti-
cle 14(2)(c) specifies that a final report should be delivered
already no later than fourteen days. It should describe
a given vulnerability’s severity and impact, information
about potential exploitation, and details about security
updates or other corrective measures made available.
Finally, it should be emphasized that while these re-
porting obligations and their deadlines are only toward
public authorities, also other parties typically need to be
informed, including further external parties, such as stake-
holders and business partners, and internal parties, such as
an organization’s management and, where applicable, its
employees (Kulikova et al., 2012). Thus, existing incident
management plans at the organizational level presumably
require or benefit from updating; a synchronization with
the law-imposed obligations might be a good idea. Due to
the various reporting obligations and strict deadlines, an
analogous point applies on the public sector side; so-called
incident triaging (ENISA, 2010) likely requires planning.
4. Crisis Management
4.1. Governance Units
The management of cyber security crises is generally
challenging in the EU due to the involvement of at least
two member states, given the definition for a large-scale
cyber security incident noted in Subsection 3.1.5. Given
the analytical levels discussed in Subsection 2.3, the man-
agement is about the national level and the supranational
level. In terms of the former, the term transnational could
be used to characterize the horizontal interstate manage-
ment and coordination between the member states in-
volved. While governments may be involved too in a case
of particularly severe crises, the term intergovernmental
might be too strong or even misleading because the ac-
tual day-to-day crisis management would not likely involve
governmental representatives in most cases. The NIS2 di-
rective also established new crisis management bodies that
are not explicitly and directly about the member states’
central governments. These also coordinate vertically to-
ward units operating at the supranational level.
In general, the NIS2 directive specifies cyber security cri-
sis management to occur through three governance bodies:
8
1. The first is the authoritative network of European
CSIRTs upon with the EU’s whole cyber security
framework was initially built (Ruohonen et al., 2016).
As the CSIRT network extends beyond Europe, the
international level may be involved too, as also in-
dicated by Fig. 2. In general, NIS2 strengthens the
European CSIRT network further, obliging also the
authoritative CSIRTs to carry out further tasks.
2. The second is a specific NIS2 cooperation group.
However, as specified in the NIS2’s Article 14(4), its
tasks are largely on the political side instead of the
operational crisis management side. Among other
things, the group is specified to help at formulating
further policies, exchanging best practices and view-
points, including regarding sectoral implementations,
carrying out risk analyses, providing strategic guid-
ance, and meeting with private sector stakeholders.
3. The third is a new European cyber crisis liaison or-
ganisation network (EU-CyCLONe). As specified in
the NIS2’s Article 16, unlike the cooperation group,
EU-CyCLONe is on the operational side; in partic-
ular, it is explicitly tasked to manage large-scale cy-
ber security incidents. In general, the management
involves similar phases that were noted in Subsec-
tion 2.4, among them preparedness and response. The
EU-CyCLONe network is specified to also coordinate
with the network of authoritative European CSIRTs.
The political side of crisis management deserves a fur-
ther comment. This side is seen in the composition of the
NIS2 cooperation group. As specified in the NIS2’s Arti-
cle 14(3), it is composed of representatives of the member
states, the EC, and ENISA, but also other public sector au-
thorities may be present, including the European External
Action Service (EEAS) who is responsible for the EU’s for-
eign policy. While the activities of the EEAS were framed
to outside of the paper’s scope via the discussion in Sub-
section 2.1, it is still worth emphasizing that cyber security
crisis management in the EU may involve also diplomacy
and related foreign policy activities, as also indicated by
the summary in Fig. 2. Analogously, the NIS2 directive’s
Article 16(3)(d) specifies that the EU-CyCLONe network
should also “support decision-making at political level”.
Given these elaborations, it is understandable that some
criticism has been levied about increased administrative
complexity, fragmentation, and bureaucratization of the
EU’s cyber security governance model in general (Ruoho-
nen, 2024a,b). Such criticism aligns with a broader branch
of research on the “bureau-politics” of crisis management
(Rosenthal et al., 1991), including potential “turf wars”
between governance bodies (Finke, 2020; Senninger et al.,
2021). This research branch is relevant to note because
rapid responses and timeliness in general are important
particularly in the cyber security context. As already the
deadlines in Fig. 4 demonstrate, rapid responses are re-
quired from EAIEs and others, but it remains generallyunclear how fast and well the responses travel through the
bureaucracy and politics at the receiving end.
4.2. Management at the Supranational Level
The CSIRT and EU-CyCLONe networks as well as the
NIS2 cooperation group operate both at the national level
and the supranational level. At the former level, these al-
low horizontal coordination between the member states;
at the latter level, these enable the member states to co-
ordinate with EU-level institutions, among them the EC
and ENISA. As was noted in Subsection 2.3.2, the Council
is on the side of intergovernmental governance, and within
the Council, the member states have permanent represen-
tatives through the Committee of the Permanent Repre-
sentatives of the Governments of the Member States to the
European Union—or Coreper in short. With these clarifi-
cations, a high-level crisis management framework at the
EU-level can be illustrated in the form of Fig. 5.
The process starts when an early warning or a later in-
cident notification is received, possibly from an EAIE or
a larger set of EAIEs, through an authoritative CSIRT or
multiple authoritative CSIRTs. For the present purposes,
the phase after the initial assessment, the EU activation
phase, is the crucial one; during this phase, the two part
definition for a large-scale cyber security incident should
be likely assessed. Politically, the activation is done by
the rotating Presidency of the Council after consulting
the EC and the EEAS’ high representative (EU, 2018).
As noted in the CSOA’s Article 20, the political activa-
tion procedure is similar to requesting help from the new
cyber reserve as well as those used for natural and other
disasters requiring civil protection. Technically, however,
the available documentation is unclear about the actual
incident analysis. The EEAS, EC, ENISA, CSIRT and
EU-CyCLONe networks are mentioned alongside Europol,
the EU’s own CSIRT (known as CERT-EU), and even the
EU’s intelligence and satellite institutions (EC, 2025a; EU,
2017). Given that the political activation depends on, or
should depend on, the adequacy and correctness of a tech-
nical incident analysis, already the amount of potential ac-
tors is enough to reiterate the earlier point about adminis-
trative complexity and its possible consequences. Nor is it
possible to deduce what might be a cost of a false positive.
Assuming that political activation is done, a further bot-
tleneck might be the subsequent phases. As seen from
Fig. 5, there are preparations and meetings before the ac-
tual EU-level coordination starts looping. If a response
time is short, these phases may cause undesirable delays.
In addition to a technical response, including the con-
tainment, eradication, and recovery tasks in the NIST’s
framework (Cichonski et al., 2012), the EU’s crisis man-
agement plans include also considerations about funding
needs, diplomatic responses, and crisis communication.
In addition to academic research (Kulikova et al., 2012),
the role and importance of crisis communication have re-
cently been emphasized also by ENISA (2024) who further

5. Discussion
5.1. Conclusion
The paper’s conclusion can be summarized by answering
to the three RQs specified in the introduction. Thus:
1. The EU’s new cyber security laws distinguish four
incident types: “conventional” incidents, severe inci-
dents, significant incidents, and large-scale incidents.
Albeit only implicitly, the last incident type is equated
to the concept of a cyber security crisis. The definition
for such a crisis is twofold: a cyber security incident
becomes a cyber security crisis either in case it ex-
ceeds a handling capacity of a single member state of
the EU or in case it significantly affects at least two
member states simultaneously.
2. The EU’s new cyber security laws significantly extend
reporting obligations toward public sector authorities.
Both operators of critical infrastructures and produc-
ers of many information technology products are man-
dated to report incidents; only reporting of the “con-
ventional” incidents is voluntary. The deadlines for
reporting are also strict.
3. Cyber security crisis management and its governance
in the EU are still strongly built upon national au-
thoritative CSIRTs and their EU-level coordination
bodies, including ENISA in particular. However, the
new laws have also brought additional governance
bodies, among them EU-CyCLONe that was specif-
ically established for cyber security crisis manage-
ment. In addition, a new staff reserve has been es-
tablished for helping countries facing cyber security
crises. Despite—or due to—these new crisis manage-
ment bodies and recent policy proposals, it remains
generally unclear how—and how well—crisis manage-
ment works at the EU-level administration.5.2. Further Work
The three concluding answers can be accompanied by
three points about further research. To motivate the first
point, it can be noted that despite uncertainties about
actual crisis management particularly at the EU-level, it
seems the NIS2 directive has addressed a commonplace
problem among many member states whose national laws
and frameworks lacked a definition for a cyber security cri-
sis (Boin et al., 2018). However, the NIS2’s definition for
a large-scale cyber security incident might also be argued
to be about too large crises in a sense that an escalation
to a national level might already be perceived as a crisis in
some severe cases. Given the overall escalation theme in
incident management research (Mitropoulos et al., 2006),
(1) further theoretical and comparative research is needed
about the analytical levels in Fig. 1. Regarding compar-
isons, a good starting point would be a comparative exam-
ination of national laws and frameworks for cyber security
crisis management in the member states. Despite the new
EU laws, national and other definitions for alert levels and
criticality itself remain unclear, non-harmonized, and gen-
erally vague (Alexopoulos et al., 2025; Ruohonen, 2024a).
Also the paper’s framings noted in Subsection 2.1 would
deserve a theoretical visit. Despite the research on hy-
brid threats, the relation between cyber security incidents
and crises, including their potential cascading effects, and
other incidents and crises remain arguably poorly under-
stood and theorized. These points justify the need for
more theoretical and conceptual research.
Regarding the EU-level cyber security crisis manage-
ment, (2) further research is required also on the roles,
duties, and other functions of various different administra-
tive units, whether national, supranational, or something
in-between. Composites such accountability, collaboration
and coordination, transparency, information sharing, de-
centralization and autonomy, and responsiveness could be
used to frame an evaluation (cf. Vu et al., 2025). How-
ever: even though it is easy to agree with an argument
that more empirical research is needed on incident man-
agement in general (Tøndel et al., 2014), a problem with
the NIS2’s large-scale incidents is that thus far at least
10
publicly disclosed cases are missing. In other words, it is
difficult to properly evaluate a management of something
that has not supposedly yet happened in Europe.
Therefore, regarding empirical research, it might make
sense to start from smaller evaluations. In particular,
(3) the increased reporting obligations, including the strict
deadlines, would offer a good topic for empirical evalu-
ation research. A lot of research and other work have
also been done to help at evaluating the efficiency, accu-
racy, and other aspects CSIRTs and their incident manage-
ment practices (Connell and Waits, 2013; Dorofee et al.,
2007, among many others). However, a broader evalu-
ation is required also with respect to EAIEs and others
who are obliged to report about incidents or do so volun-
tarily. Given the CRA’s and NIS2’s strict deadlines, as
well as the penalties from non-compliance, it may be that
organizations and others will report eagerly and possibly
incautiously. Thus, the quality of early warnings, inci-
dents notifications, and particularly final reports (Busetti
and Scanni, 2025), including a rate of false positives, would
provide a good research topic with practical relevance. A
related topic would involve examining whether reporting
guidelines and a systematic reporting format might in-
crease reporting quality and reduce noise. As it stands,
neither the NIS2 directive nor the other laws say anything
about what should be reported. The topic is generally im-
portant because regulatory obligations upon incident man-
agement have recently been argued to work poorly in im-
proving organizations’ cyber security postures (Patterson
et al., 2024). This point serves well to end the paper by
reiterating that something should always be learned from
cyber security incidents and crises.

cyber security crisis management in the european union

abstract
incident management is a classical topic in cyber security recently the european union eu has started to consider
also the relation between cyber security incidents and cyber security crises these considerations and preparations
including those specified in the eus new cyber security laws constitute the papers topic according to an analysis of
the laws and associated policy documents i cyber security crises are equated in the eu to largescale cyber security
incidents that either exceed a handling capacity of a single member state or affect at least two member states for this
and other purposes ii the new laws substantially increase mandatory reporting about cyber security incidents including
but not limited to the largescale incidents despite the laws and new governance bodies established by them however
iii the working of actual cyber security crisis management remains unclear particularly at the eulevel with these
policy research results the paper advances the domain of cyber security incident management research by elaborating
how european law perceives cyber security crises and their relation to cyber security incidents paving the way for many
relevant further research topics with practical relevance whether theoretical conceptual or empirical
keywords risk management risk analysis incident management crisis management regulations governance eu
1 introduction
europe has been in crisis management mode for a
decade and a half handler 2024 p 1 although the
statement quoted is true in many respects it does not
yet apply to the cyber security domain in other words
to the best of the authors knowledge there has not been a
truly largescale paneuropean cyber security crisis thus
far this statement does not mean that the eu would
not have prepared for such a crisis these preparations
including those mandated by the eus new cyber security
laws are what the paper is about the papers relevance
and contributions can be elaborated with four brief points
to start from practical relevance first the topic is
timely in fact the european commission ec just re
cently released a new proposal for handling largescale
crosscountry cyber security crises in europe ec 2025a
the second point follows from this timeliness again to
the best of the authors knowledge the paper is the first
to elaborate cyber security crisis management in the eu
context while there are some existing works they have
concentrated on national cyber security crisis manage
ment boeke 2017 collier 2016 stby and katt 2020
that is the eu context has been missing thus far includ
ing with respect to the eus new judicial framework in
corresponding author
email address jukmmmisdudk jukka ruohonenaddition governance below national administrations has
received limited attention in general b eland et al 2024
subsequently third the paper contributes to the recent ef
forts to digest and analyze the eus many new cyber secu
rity laws and their implications alexopoulos et al 2025
busetti and scanni 2025 mueck and gaie 2025 rataj
2025 ruohonen 2024b ruohonen et al 2025 among
many others regarding existing research and knowledge
more generally fourth and last the paper contributes to
the incident management research domain by elaborating
analyzing and theorizing on how incidents are related to
and may transform into crises because crises typically
have immense consequences the papers overall relevance
is welljustified it is important to understand how the
eus new cyber security legal framework is designed with
crisis management in mind
with respect to the last point both incident manage
ment research and frameworks for it have traditionally op
erated at the organizational level incidents are something
that organizations may face and thus they should also pre
pare for them for instance a classical incident manage
ment framework from the national institute of standards
and technology nist defines cyber security incident as
a violation or imminent threat of violation of any cy
ber security policies acceptable use policies or standard
security practices established and enforced by organiza
tions cichonski et al 2012 p 6 the organizational fo
cus is thus clear according to an early literature review
preprint submitted to elsevier april 22 2025arxiv250414220v1  cscr  19 apr 2025
a similar focus is present in many other wellknown frame
works and standards for incident management and closely
related topics tndel et al 2014 from the previous
quotation it also follows that an organization should have
cyber security policies established and enforced because
otherwise an incident remains only implicit and vaguely
defined a similar claim applies to cyber security crisis
management also larger entities whether industry sec
tors geographic regions or countries and beyond should
have policies in place for handling cyber security crises
as will be seen in the eu these policies are partially but
still explicitly written in recent cyber security laws
a further point about the organizational focus is that it
has typically been present also in different sociotechnical
frameworks for incident management and cyber security
management in general al sabbagh and kowalski 2015
jaatun et al 2009 van haastrecht et al 2021 moti
vated by a recent work on layered cyber security frame
works panteli et al 2025 the paper adopts a multilevel
perspective sometimes used in the sociotechnical frame
works malatji et al 2019 but extends it beyond orga
nizations thus the first part in the sociotechnical term
refers to an adjective societal and particularly a noun eu
ropean although societal cyber security is not a well
defined concept it has sometimes been discussed in a con
text of critical infrastructure protection gjesvik 2019
such a framing serves also the papers purposes well be
cause among the eu laws considered is an important new
law for critical infrastructure protection in europe
with these motivating remarks in mind the following
three research questions rqs are examined
rq1 what constitutes a cyber security crisis in the
european union
rq2 what do recent eu laws impose upon cyber
security incident and crisis management
rq3 how cyber security crises are managed gov
erned and coordinated in the eu and by whom
the papers remainder is structured into four sections
the opening section 2 motivates the background further
including with respect to the multilevel approach pursued
and the eu laws considered the methodology for analyz
ing these is also elaborated and a few clarifying framings
are also done to restrict and limit the papers scope sec
tion 3 continues by elaborating how different lawimposed
incident types are related to the multilevel approach in
general the section answers to rq1 and rq2 the sub
sequent section 4 answers to rq3 by elaborating the var
ious institutions organizations and networks involved in
cyber security crisis management in the eu context the
final section 5 presents a concluding discussion2 background
21 framings
some framings are required for limiting and aligning
the papers scope to a manageable composition to be
gin with the paper is framed toward cyber security alone
the papers opening quotation about europe having been
in a crisis management mode for a long time helps to un
derstand that crises vary a lot from financial crises all
the way to wars and the existential climate change crisis
while notions such as cascading effects and risks adkins
et al 2020 ruohonen 2024a ruohonen et al 2025 make
it understandable that many crises may be interconnected
to each other no attempts are made to connect cyber se
curity crises to other crises the same applies regarding
threats some cyber security threats including particu
larly those related to advanced persistent threat apt ac
tors are today in europe often perceived to be linked
with a broader class of socalled hybrid threats anagnos
takis 2023 jungwirth et al 2023 while acknowledging
the linkages theoretical and practical validity no attempts
are made to move beyond plain cyber security by implica
tion as hybrid threats may involve also a military dimen
sion also the eus other cyber security pillars christou
2016 ruohonen 2024b whether cyber defense or data
protection are excluded from the papers scope further
more theorizing about different types of cyber security
crises are further omitted for brevity clarity and align
ment with the eus laws
with respect to largescale cyber security crises enisa
2024 p 12 emphasizes a need to distinguish between a
creeping crisis which simmers under the radar before
suddenly and unexpectedly erupting an acute crisis
which is sudden unforeseen and can have a massive im
pact in a very short amount of time and a recurring cri
sis which occurs almost continuously similar categoriza
tions have been presented in the academic literature boin
et al 2018 head 2022 of these three types denial of
service attacks in particular could be seen as something
recurrent whereas a severe data breach or a successful
ransomware attack might be seen to belong to the cate
gory of acute crises though these examples are more
about incidents than crises therefore also risk analysis is
presumably more challenging when trying to assess crises
rater than incidents when operating at a level of societies
or beyond rather than at the conventional organizational
level at the societal level an example of a creeping crisis
might involve a discovered largescale espionage campaign
conducted by an apt actor beyond these brief remarks
as said more elaborate theorization is left for further work
22 methodology
the paper operates in the domain of policy studies
within this domain a separation between policy analysis
and policy process research is sometimes done broadly
2
speaking the former is about prescriptive research seek
ing to inform policymaking whether in terms of evalua
tions impact assessments or something else while the lat
ter is descriptive research focused particularly on theory
building deleon and weible 2010 secchi 2016 given
this characterization the paper is about policy research
regarding descriptive policy research an ex post post hoc 
or retrospective approach is used cf patton et al 2016
this choice is also unavoidable because the eu laws con
sidered have already been enacted
regarding ex ante policy analysis it is worth remarking
that the ec did prior impact assessments for mostbut
not all ep 2024of the laws considered in the paper
for the papers purposes it is particularly worth remark
ing that these assessments indicated a lack of joint situa
tional awareness and crisis management between the mem
ber states and between them and the eulevel administra
tion information sharing was concluded to operate on an
ad hoc basis and crossborder spillovers were omitted from
risk analyses ec 2020 pp 2122 this point justifies an
academic expert evaluation of the three rqs postulated
regarding theorybuilding the paper analyzes and the
orizes how the eus new laws align with common analyt
ical frameworks used in incident and crisis management
research on the side of engineering and computer sci
ence within which theorybuilding often has a different
meaning the paper aligns with requirements engineering
research within which legal requirements are a distinct
genre ruohonen et al 2025 this research branch jus
tifies rq2 in other words it is important to know what
laws require whether from organizations producers or
public administrations once an answer is known it is pos
sible to continue toward empirical policy research with
out knowing the legal requirements formulation of rele
vant research questions is difficultif not questionable al
together this point also applies to the framings done in
sofar as policy analysis is concerned it is pointless to eval
uate responses to hybrid threats without knowing about
the preparations and frameworks for handling them
23 analytical levels
the papers conceptual and theoretical background can
be motivated by considering an analytical relation be
tween incidents and crisis through different vertical levels
of analysis often used in social sciences a term multi
level analysis is sometimes used to refer to approaches
that operate at two or more such levels b eland et al
2024 hutzschenreuter et al 2020 the term should not
be equated to multilevel cyber security although there
is a rough conceptual similarity because both involve a hi
erarchy anderson 2020 in any case an incident that
involves multiple analytical levels could be called a multi
level incidentor depending on which levels an incident
has transcended a cyber security crisis231 the international level
the international level is at the top of the hierarchy
when operating at this level an analysis typically func
tions horizontally focusing on relations between states in
terms of cyber security good examples about such inter
state transnational relations would cover cyber norms cy
ber diplomacy and even what is known and debated as
cyber war however as said such topics are beyond the
papers scope another point is that it is also possible
to consider information systems and other technical solu
tions at this level such systems and solutions are those
that transcend both national and organizational bound
aries rukanova et al 2015 such transcendence can also
been seen as something that separates cyber security inci
dents from cyber security crises
if a cyber security incident escalates to the international
level it is not really any more a mere incident but rather
a crisis with this point in mind fig 1 displays seven an
alytical levels through which incidents may become crises

figure 1 analytical levels adopted from enisa 2024 pp 1718
232 the supranational level
below the international level is a supranational level
this level is at which the eu operates the european
union is a supranational union at the same time how
ever it operates in intergovernmental terms the council
of the european union would be the prime example in this
regard in contrast the european union agency for cy
bersecurity enisa operates at the supranational level
although intergovernmental tenets may still be present in
terms of staffing and related aspects while there is a
classical debate regarding the meaning of and interplay be
tween these two theoretical governance terms bickerton
et al 2022 handler 2024 tsebelis and garrett 2021
without a particular loss of specificity and rigor the term
supranationalism is used in case there is no particular rea
son to emphasize the intergovernmental dimension
note also a difference between the terms transnational
and intergovernmental the latter is about relations be
tween governments as is the case in the council in which
ministers or other heads of states represent their mem
3
ber states whereas the former can be seen to cover also
supranational governance because the meaning is essen
tially about relations between nations these relations
may be about states but they may also include transna
tional nongovernmental organizations different transna
tional collaboration and coordination networks and inter
national organizations g anzle et al 2022 when such
transnational relations are accounted for the term multi
level governance can be seen to cover also a horizontal
dimension a coordination and collaboration between dif
ferent entities not directly linked to governmental repre
sentatives these terminological clarifications are impor
tant because the eus overall multilevel crisis manage
ment framework covers numerous actors operating at dif
ferent governance levels and policy areas anagnostakis
2023 the concepts also provide a theoretical foundation
for analyzing the eus cyber security crisis management
framework in terms of governance and coordination
233 the national regional and sectoral levels
when taking a step downwards from the supranational
level the national level is encountered regarding gover
nance authoritative computer security incident response
teams csirts are particularly relevant in europe ac
cording to both old and new eu laws each member state
should have an authoritative csirt or a related com
petent authority for nationwide incident management1
however presently it remains still somewhat unclear how
national administrations are or will be arranged in each
and every member state by hypothesis the divergence is
or will be large across the twentyseven member states
although there are no clear demarcations operations at
the national level are sometimes but not always about
crisis management rather than incident management the
same could be said even about the regional level espe
cially when keeping in mind that it includes both smaller
geographically bound administrative units as well as larger
geographic units such as is the case in the germanys fed
eralist administration also crisis management tends to
be decentralized to the regional l ander  level in germany
although strategic management and highlevel political co
ordination occurs at the federal level christensen et al
2016 without the federalist twist the setup is rather
similar to many other european countries within which
strategic and political aspects are oftentimes centralized
while the operational level is often more or less decen
tralized christensen et al 2016 gjesvik 2019 ramsell
and wihlborg 2012 regions also intervene with indus
try sectors in many member states whether an exam
ple is about the ruhr region in germany or the emilia
romagna region in italy specialized industry activity has
1here the adjective authoritative is used for emphasizing a dif
ference to other csirts including sectoral teams as well as teams
within organizations and companies note also that in practice the
abbreviation csirt is equivalent to an abbreviation cert denot
ing a computer emergency response teamoften concentrated to specific regions in europe and also
elsewhere authoritative csirts in some european coun
tries have also been decentralized with sectoral special
ization in mind boin et al 2018 in terms of incident
management many industries also have different sectoral
and regional coordination networks and governance hubs
234 the organizational and individual levels
then below the sectoral level is the organizational
level as said in the introduction this level has been
the traditional focal point in incident management and
its research again coordination may occur horizon
tally between organizations interorganizational coordi
nation and within organizations intraorganizational co
ordination and vertically between organizations and in
dividuals heine 2019 panteli et al 2025 the intra
organizational coordination is relevant also for establish
ing organizational csirts typical choices for large orga
nizations include outsourcing a centralized organization
wide team or distributed teams across an organizations
departments mitropoulos et al 2006 cichonski et al
2012 organizations may also coordinate vertically with
sectoral or regional entities such as industry associations
as well as entities operating at a national level including
authoritative csirts in particular finally as seen from
fig 1 it is also possible to consider incidents at a level
of individuals whether employees citizens or consumers
given the extensive research and evidence on the human
factors in cyber security it is also possible that an incident
affecting an individual escalates to the organizational level
or even beyond that
235 an example of a multilevel incident
a good example about a multilevel incident would be
the attacks against danish energy sector companies in
2023 given that over twenty energy sector companies
were compromised the incident prompted also interna
tional media attention antoniuk 2023 regarding the
analytical levels the example is illuminating because it
involved three or four levels in fig 1
to begin with the incident was not only organizational
but also sectoral due to the involvement of multiple com
panies in the same sector given the potential concen
tration of the energy sector companies to some particular
regions in denmark the incident could be perhaps inter
preted to involve also the regional level in any case the
sectoral level manifested itself also in the investigation con
ducted by sektorcert 2023 a nonprofit csirt com
posed by danish critical infrastructure companies and op
erators the investigation revealed that the compromises
were conducted by exploiting a vulnerability in a firewall
product2furthermore an update had been available but
the energy sector companies had not patched their firewalls
for a reason or another during the incident management
the issue escalated further to the national level
2cve202328771
4
among other things cfcs 2023 the authoritative
csirt in denmark raised the threat level against the
danish energy sector to the very high level category how
ever while multiple levels were involved the incident is
not yet something that could be interpreted as a cyber se
curity crisis according to the eus laws this point will
become clear in subsection 31 that elaborates different
incident types present in the recently enacted eu laws
24 the eus strategy
the eus new cyber security strategy can be sum
marized in the form of fig 2 three of the strategys
pillarsprevention detection and responseresemble
rather similar phases in incident management frameworks
for instance the nists noted framework is structured
around preparation detection and analysis containment
eradication and recovery and postincident phases ci
chonski et al 2012 cf also mitropoulos et al 2006
rather analogously enisa 2024 builds upon preven
tion preparedness and response and recovery phases an
other example would be prepare detect and recover and
learn jaatun et al 2009 a further point is that the
eus strategy is structured around specific laws which
are also supported by funding instruments education re

figure 2 the eus current cyber security strategy in a nutshell
adopted from ec 2025b
before continuing to enumerate the laws covered it
should be emphasized that there are many further eu laws
explicitly or implicitly related to cyber security some of
which are sectorspecific and some others of which over
lap with each other ec 2025a fischerh ubner et al
2021 ruohonen et al 2025 against this backdrop it is
no wonder that regulatory fragmentation and complexity
have been a source of commonly expressed criticism alex
opoulos et al 2025 ruohonen 2024b in any case it
should be emphasized that the specific laws considered
are particularly relevant for the papers topic in other
words as will elaborated in section 3 the laws also help
to understand how a transcendence from an incident to a
unionwide crisis is legally perceived and structured
of the four laws abbreviated in fig 2 particularly im
portant are the socalled nis2 directive eu 2022 and
the cyber resilience act cra regulation eu 2024although a concept of essential and important entities
eaies is used in the nis2 directive the directive is es
sentially about critical infrastructure protection overall
the directive builds upon a sectoral approach numerous
sectors are enumerated as carrying critical societal or eco
nomic activities to quote from the nis2s article 22b
this quotation aligns with the notion of societal cyber se
curity noted in the introduction the actual sectors spec
ified range from traditional critical infrastructure sectors
such as energy and transport to banking healthcare fi
nance drinking and waste water management the inter
nets core infrastructure and space technologies
in contrast the cra regulation is a productspecific
law among other things it specifies socalled essential cy
ber security requirements for almost all information tech
nology products as these requirements have already been
considered in detail ruohonen et al 2025 including
with respect to new obligations regarding vulnerability co
ordination and disclosure ruohonen and timmers 2024
in what follows the cra is only discussed with respect to
its mandates for incident reporting having said that it
is worth remarking that the cras essential requirement
about preferably automated security updates would have
prevented the danish energy sector case noted earlier in
subsection 235 and furthermore some of the essential
requirements contain also elements aligning with the tech
nical detection and prevention of incidents
regarding the cra more generally also the older cy
bersecurity act csa can be mentioned eu 2019
while it strengthened the role and mandates of enisa
it also introduce a common cyber security certification
scheme for information technology products this certi
fication scheme aligns with the cra in that conformance
can be attained also but not only through certification
given that standards are also an important part of the
cra and compliance with it the regulation seems to have
at least partially answered to criticism from the industry
and practitioners fischerh ubner et al 2021 finally
recently a new cyber solidarity act csoa regulation
was agreed upon eu 2025 as can be seen from fig 2
it covers aspects from all the three pillars noted earlier
a couple of additional remarks are in order before con
tinuing to elaborate the laws and their implications in de
tail the first remark is that deterring of cyber security
threats appears in fig 2 while this topic is beyond the
papers scope it can be noted that deterrence has long
been debated in the literature goodman 2010 among
many others some authors having taken a critical stance
about the working of deterrence in the cyber security con
text among them soesanto and smeets 2021 the sec
ond remark is that all of the laws are more or less risk
based some explicitly and some only implicitly in partic
ular the nis2 directives article 21 obliges eaies to carry
out comprehensive risk analyses these should be done by
following a socalled allhazards approach which is also
familiar from the academic literature ayyub et al 2007
izumi 2024 according to nis2 the approach means that
5
anything and everything from incident handling backups
and supplychain security to security awareness campaigns
and business continuity should be assessed the cra too
is a riskbased regulation the essential cyber security re
quirements should be prioritized designed implemented
against particular productspecific risks identified
3 incident types
31 events
events including alerts whether from intrusion detec
tion systems other monitoring systems or somewhere
else are important building blocks for incident manage
ment cichonski et al 2012 these also allow under
standing how incidents may transform into crises accord
ing to the eus jurisprudence thus fig 3 displays the
core event types in the new eu laws the figure can be
elaborated by moving from the bottom to the top from
alerts to incidents severe incidents and beyond in line
with the previous discussion at least the last incident type
shown is analytically already on the side of crises

figure 3 an event type hierarchy
as was remarked in subsection 24 the cras essen
tial cyber security requirements for products contain el
ements that may or should foster the detection cyber
security incidents for instance the requirements include
a monitoring functionality for a products internal activ
ity including with respect to authorizations and integrity
guarantees ruohonen et al 2025 in addition as seen
also from the earlier fig 2 the csoa regulation is rele
vant too with respect to incident detection in particular
the regulation envisions a development of a largescale
paneuropean network of cyber security alert systems for
coordinated incident detection and improved situational
awareness capabilities while these systems are labeled as
cyber hubs in the regulation they are essentially what
security operation centers socs and threat intelligence
systems in general are about the network is planned
upon voluntary pooling of national alert systems into large
crossborder systems the national systems may include
not only those maintained by authoritative csirts but
also those operated by private sector companies311 near misses
an alert can be a false positive or a true positive al
though the nists definition noted in the introduction
covers both for the present purposes it makes sense to
frame incidents only toward true positives regarding false
positives the eus recent laws introduce a concept of near
misses a near miss is defined in the nis2s article 65
to mean an event that could have compromised the avail
ability authenticity integrity or confidentiality of stored
transmitted or processed data or of the services offered
by or accessible via network and information systems
but that was successfully prevented thus within the
context of incident management the concept can be seen
to be about false positives about alerts that were suc
cessfully prevented from becoming actual incidents true
positives in any case reporting about near misses is vol
untary according to article 152 in the cra regulation
manufacturers and other parties whether natural or le
gal persons may voluntarily report near misses either to
a national authoritative csirt or enisa likewise ac
cording to article 30 in the nis2 directive eaies may
voluntary report near misses to a authoritative csirt or
some related public sector authority
voluntary reporting seems sensible already due to over
head and related reasons because alerts are voluminous
due to various monitoring systems deployed by organiza
tions most of them are false positives and interoperability
is a typical issue with the monitoring systems and their re
porting formats alahmadi et al 2022 zibak et al 2022
analogously to abuse reporting in the internet jhaveri
et al 2017 a signal to noise ratio is often also low
against these backdrops a mandatory reporting of near
misses would have presumably required large financial in
vestments and considerable coordination between various
stakeholders involved including the authoritative euro
pean csirts and producers of cyber security monitoring
solutions the issues with false positives in the cyber secu
rity context are wellrecognized in the literature also more
generally not only is a minimization of them generally
difficult but also a cost of handling them is often signifi
cant bhatt et al 2014 however the eu laws do not say
anything how organizations should actually demarcate be
tween false and true positives and whether there are any
consequences from accidentally reporting a false positive
as a true positive or the other way around
312 incidents
also reporting of most but not all true positivesthat
is according to the terminology adopted incidentsis vol
untary according to the nis2s article 66 an incident
is defined as an event compromising the availability au
thenticity integrity or confidentiality of stored transmit
ted or processed data or of the services offered by or acces
sible via network and information systems when com
pared to the earlier definition for near misses an incident
is thus something that has actually compromised data or
6
services while the definition aligns with classical fram
ings brownlee and guttman 1998 there is a difference
to the nists definition noted in the introduction is also
present although availability authenticity integrity and
confidentiality may well belong to an organizations cyber
security policy the nis2 only notes in article 24 cyber
security policies with respect to open source software asso
ciations in any case according to the nis2s article 30
reporting of these conventional incidents is voluntary
313 severe incidents
when moving a step upward in the event hierarchy
see fig 3 the cra regulation but not the nis2 direc
tive uses a concept of severe incidents it is mandatory
to report such incidents to both a national authoritative
csirt and enisa according to the cras article 143
a twofold definition for severe incidents is given in the reg
ulations article 145 the first part emphasizes negative
impacts andpotential negative impacts upon a products
ability to protect the availability authenticity integrity
or confidentiality of data or services whereas the second
part emphasizes an execution and a potential execution
of malicious code it remains to be seen how manufac
turers will interpret the demarcation between the impacts
and executions on one hand and the potential impacts and
executions on the other hand
another important point is that the cra is about man
ufacturers of information technology products not about
operators of such products including eaies covered by
the nis2 directive with some relaxations manufacturers
are also mandated to report about actively exploited vul
nerabilities ruohonen and timmers 2024 in any case
the divergence between the scopes of the two eu laws
reiterates a criticism expressed in the literature about a
lack of an explicit legal synchronization between different
reporting obligations imposed by different laws fischer
h ubner et al 2021 ruohonen 2024a in particular in
case a manufacturer reports to a national authoritative
csirt and enisa about a severe incident either the
given csirt or enisa or both should presumably con
sequently report to all eaies and others using the man
ufacturers given product to which the severe incident ap
plies again it remains to be seen how such consecutive
reporting will work in practice
314 significant incidents
the remaining two incident types are specified in the
nis2 directive according to the directives article 233
a significant incident either has caused or is capable of
causing severe operational disruption of the services or fi
nancial loss for the entity concerned or it has affected
or is capable of affecting other natural or legal persons by
causing considerable material or nonmaterial damage
the again twofold definition warrants three brief remarks
the first remark is related to the earlier point about
potential effects the wording capable of yet again en
tails a demarcation problem between actual significant incidents and those merely conveying a probability of such
incidents presently no guidance is available upon this
demarcation busetti and scanni 2025 the second re
mark is related to the wording about severe operational
disruption here it would seem that anything from se
vere denial of service attacks to severe ransomware attacks
are in the scope the definitions emphasis of severe finan
cial losses further underlines ransomware attacks although
also other socalled destructive cyber attacks are likely in
the nis2s scope the third remark is about the empha
sis about considerable material or nonmaterial damage
to natural persons therefore it has been suspected that
also severe personal data breaches are in the directives
scope ruohonen et al 2025 but a definite conclusion
can likely be given only after guidelines have been released
or enforcement has occurred while keeping these and
other potential interpretation issues in mind eaies must
report about significant incidents to a national authorita
tive csirts or where applicable other public authorities
as well as other entities concerned according to the nis2s
article 231 thus broadly speaking unlike conven
tional incidents significant incidents fall into a category
of mandatory reporting by eaies
315 largescale incidents
finally there is the notion about largescale cyber se
curity incidents a largescale incident is defined in the
nis2 directives article 67 as an incident which either
a exceeds a handling capacity of a single member state
or which b has a significant impact on at least two mem
ber states regarding incident management frameworks
the first part of the definition resembles a concept of esca
lation at the organizational level an organizational csirt
or some related security team cannot get an incident under
control on its own cf jaatun et al 2009 another point
is that the ecs 2025a p 12 noted recent proposal clar
ifies that these largescale incidents are what is meant by
a cyber security crisis in the eu context while keeping
the earlier remarks about terminology in mind a cyber
security crisis is thus something that moves from the na
tional level to the supranational level in fig 1 also the
nis2s recital 69 clarifies this point by noting that large
scale incidents may escalate and turn into fullyfledged
crises despite such an escalation potential and interest
ingly enough nis2 does not explicitly say about reporting
obligations of largescale incidents but because these must
be something that also satisfy the definition for significant
incidents reporting can be interpreted as mandatory
the csoas cyber security alert systems noted in sub
section 31 are also related to largescale cyber security
incidents according to the regulations article 7 partic
ularly the envisioned crossborder alert systems are seen
as relevant for detecting largescale incidents and shar
ing information about them there are also a couple of
other important points to make about the relation between
largescale incidents and the csoa regulation
the first point is about the exceeding of a member
7
states handling capacity used in the definition for a large
scale cyber security incident here the csoas article 14
specifies an establishment of a specific cyber security re
serve for handling largescale incidents the reserve is
composed by national public sector representatives as well
as other trusted parties according to article 15 a mem
ber state in need may then request help from the reserve
to recover from both significant and largescale cyber secu
rity incidents furthermore the csoas article 19 spec
ifies that help can be requested also by countries outside
of the eu provided that they are taking part in the eus
digital europe programme dep a funding instrument
for digital technologies and digitalization in general
the second point is that the csoa specifies a new cyber
security incident review mechanism its scope is restricted
to significant and largescale incidents enisa and a net
work of authoritative csirt are specified as the respon
sible parties for the actual reviews according to the regu
lations article 211 in line with the postincident activ
ities in the nists incident management framework ci
chonski et al 2012 the reviews are used for improving the
unions and the member states cyber security practices
despite an incidents or a crisis negative consequences
there is always also something to learn from them
32 deadlines
there are strict deadlines for incidents that are manda
tory to report when comparing the cras article 14
and the nis2 directives article 23 the wordings about
the deadlines are not verbatim similar but their meaning
is more or less the same for this reason the deadlines
can be summarized in the form of fig 4 as was noted
in the preceding subsection 315 the deadlines for report
ing about largescale incidents are implicit but follow from
their inevitable connection to significant incidents an
other clarifying remark needed is that the cras notion
about actively exploited vulnerabilities is not about inci
dents per se but can be discussed alongside them because
the reporting deadlines are similar

figure 4 reporting deadlines for actively exploited vulnerabilities
and severe significant and by implication largescale incidents
thus severe significant and largescale incidents
should be initially reported to an authoritative csirt
or some other competent authority no later than twenty
four hours after becoming aware of them then a more
detailed incident report should be delivered no later thanseventytwo hours after becoming aware of a given inci
dent the report delivered should include an initial as
sessment about a given incident including its severity and
impact as well as where applicable any indicators of a
compromise after these two reports an authoritative
csirt may request status updates at any time a final
report should be delivered within a month in addition
to severity and impact the final report should contain a
root cause analysis any applied and ongoing mitigation
measures and where applicable an assessment about any
crossborder impacts the crossborder impact assessment
again signifies the relation to largescale incidents re
garding actively exploited vulnerabilities the cras arti
cle 142c specifies that a final report should be delivered
already no later than fourteen days it should describe
a given vulnerabilitys severity and impact information
about potential exploitation and details about security
updates or other corrective measures made available
finally it should be emphasized that while these re
porting obligations and their deadlines are only toward
public authorities also other parties typically need to be
informed including further external parties such as stake
holders and business partners and internal parties such as
an organizations management and where applicable its
employees kulikova et al 2012 thus existing incident
management plans at the organizational level presumably
require or benefit from updating a synchronization with
the lawimposed obligations might be a good idea due to
the various reporting obligations and strict deadlines an
analogous point applies on the public sector side socalled
incident triaging enisa 2010 likely requires planning
4 crisis management
41 governance units
the management of cyber security crises is generally
challenging in the eu due to the involvement of at least
two member states given the definition for a largescale
cyber security incident noted in subsection 315 given
the analytical levels discussed in subsection 23 the man
agement is about the national level and the supranational
level in terms of the former the term transnational could
be used to characterize the horizontal interstate manage
ment and coordination between the member states in
volved while governments may be involved too in a case
of particularly severe crises the term intergovernmental
might be too strong or even misleading because the ac
tual daytoday crisis management would not likely involve
governmental representatives in most cases the nis2 di
rective also established new crisis management bodies that
are not explicitly and directly about the member states
central governments these also coordinate vertically to
ward units operating at the supranational level
in general the nis2 directive specifies cyber security cri
sis management to occur through three governance bodies
8
1 the first is the authoritative network of european
csirts upon with the eus whole cyber security
framework was initially built ruohonen et al 2016
as the csirt network extends beyond europe the
international level may be involved too as also in
dicated by fig 2 in general nis2 strengthens the
european csirt network further obliging also the
authoritative csirts to carry out further tasks
2 the second is a specific nis2 cooperation group
however as specified in the nis2s article 144 its
tasks are largely on the political side instead of the
operational crisis management side among other
things the group is specified to help at formulating
further policies exchanging best practices and view
points including regarding sectoral implementations
carrying out risk analyses providing strategic guid
ance and meeting with private sector stakeholders
3 the third is a new european cyber crisis liaison or
ganisation network eucyclone as specified in
the nis2s article 16 unlike the cooperation group
eucyclone is on the operational side in partic
ular it is explicitly tasked to manage largescale cy
ber security incidents in general the management
involves similar phases that were noted in subsec
tion 24 among them preparedness and response the
eucyclone network is specified to also coordinate
with the network of authoritative european csirts
the political side of crisis management deserves a fur
ther comment this side is seen in the composition of the
nis2 cooperation group as specified in the nis2s arti
cle 143 it is composed of representatives of the member
states the ec and enisa but also other public sector au
thorities may be present including the european external
action service eeas who is responsible for the eus for
eign policy while the activities of the eeas were framed
to outside of the papers scope via the discussion in sub
section 21 it is still worth emphasizing that cyber security
crisis management in the eu may involve also diplomacy
and related foreign policy activities as also indicated by
the summary in fig 2 analogously the nis2 directives
article 163d specifies that the eucyclone network
should also support decisionmaking at political level
given these elaborations it is understandable that some
criticism has been levied about increased administrative
complexity fragmentation and bureaucratization of the
eus cyber security governance model in general ruoho
nen 2024ab such criticism aligns with a broader branch
of research on the bureaupolitics of crisis management
rosenthal et al 1991 including potential turf wars
between governance bodies finke 2020 senninger et al
2021 this research branch is relevant to note because
rapid responses and timeliness in general are important
particularly in the cyber security context as already the
deadlines in fig 4 demonstrate rapid responses are re
quired from eaies and others but it remains generallyunclear how fast and well the responses travel through the
bureaucracy and politics at the receiving end
42 management at the supranational level
the csirt and eucyclone networks as well as the
nis2 cooperation group operate both at the national level
and the supranational level at the former level these al
low horizontal coordination between the member states
at the latter level these enable the member states to co
ordinate with eulevel institutions among them the ec
and enisa as was noted in subsection 232 the council
is on the side of intergovernmental governance and within
the council the member states have permanent represen
tatives through the committee of the permanent repre
sentatives of the governments of the member states to the
european unionor coreper in short with these clarifi
cations a highlevel crisis management framework at the
eulevel can be illustrated in the form of fig 5
the process starts when an early warning or a later in
cident notification is received possibly from an eaie or
a larger set of eaies through an authoritative csirt or
multiple authoritative csirts for the present purposes
the phase after the initial assessment the eu activation
phase is the crucial one during this phase the two part
definition for a largescale cyber security incident should
be likely assessed politically the activation is done by
the rotating presidency of the council after consulting
the ec and the eeas high representative eu 2018
as noted in the csoas article 20 the political activa
tion procedure is similar to requesting help from the new
cyber reserve as well as those used for natural and other
disasters requiring civil protection technically however
the available documentation is unclear about the actual
incident analysis the eeas ec enisa csirt and
eucyclone networks are mentioned alongside europol
the eus own csirt known as certeu and even the
eus intelligence and satellite institutions ec 2025a eu
2017 given that the political activation depends on or
should depend on the adequacy and correctness of a tech
nical incident analysis already the amount of potential ac
tors is enough to reiterate the earlier point about adminis
trative complexity and its possible consequences nor is it
possible to deduce what might be a cost of a false positive
assuming that political activation is done a further bot
tleneck might be the subsequent phases as seen from
fig 5 there are preparations and meetings before the ac
tual eulevel coordination starts looping if a response
time is short these phases may cause undesirable delays
in addition to a technical response including the con
tainment eradication and recovery tasks in the nists
framework cichonski et al 2012 the eus crisis man
agement plans include also considerations about funding
needs diplomatic responses and crisis communication
in addition to academic research kulikova et al 2012
the role and importance of crisis communication have re
cently been emphasized also by enisa 2024 who further

5 discussion
51 conclusion
the papers conclusion can be summarized by answering
to the three rqs specified in the introduction thus
1 the eus new cyber security laws distinguish four
incident types conventional incidents severe inci
dents significant incidents and largescale incidents
albeit only implicitly the last incident type is equated
to the concept of a cyber security crisis the definition
for such a crisis is twofold a cyber security incident
becomes a cyber security crisis either in case it ex
ceeds a handling capacity of a single member state of
the eu or in case it significantly affects at least two
member states simultaneously
2 the eus new cyber security laws significantly extend
reporting obligations toward public sector authorities
both operators of critical infrastructures and produc
ers of many information technology products are man
dated to report incidents only reporting of the con
ventional incidents is voluntary the deadlines for
reporting are also strict
3 cyber security crisis management and its governance
in the eu are still strongly built upon national au
thoritative csirts and their eulevel coordination
bodies including enisa in particular however the
new laws have also brought additional governance
bodies among them eucyclone that was specif
ically established for cyber security crisis manage
ment in addition a new staff reserve has been es
tablished for helping countries facing cyber security
crises despiteor due tothese new crisis manage
ment bodies and recent policy proposals it remains
generally unclear howand how wellcrisis manage
ment works at the eulevel administration52 further work
the three concluding answers can be accompanied by
three points about further research to motivate the first
point it can be noted that despite uncertainties about
actual crisis management particularly at the eulevel it
seems the nis2 directive has addressed a commonplace
problem among many member states whose national laws
and frameworks lacked a definition for a cyber security cri
sis boin et al 2018 however the nis2s definition for
a largescale cyber security incident might also be argued
to be about too large crises in a sense that an escalation
to a national level might already be perceived as a crisis in
some severe cases given the overall escalation theme in
incident management research mitropoulos et al 2006
1 further theoretical and comparative research is needed
about the analytical levels in fig 1 regarding compar
isons a good starting point would be a comparative exam
ination of national laws and frameworks for cyber security
crisis management in the member states despite the new
eu laws national and other definitions for alert levels and
criticality itself remain unclear nonharmonized and gen
erally vague alexopoulos et al 2025 ruohonen 2024a
also the papers framings noted in subsection 21 would
deserve a theoretical visit despite the research on hy
brid threats the relation between cyber security incidents
and crises including their potential cascading effects and
other incidents and crises remain arguably poorly under
stood and theorized these points justify the need for
more theoretical and conceptual research
regarding the eulevel cyber security crisis manage
ment 2 further research is required also on the roles
duties and other functions of various different administra
tive units whether national supranational or something
inbetween composites such accountability collaboration
and coordination transparency information sharing de
centralization and autonomy and responsiveness could be
used to frame an evaluation cf vu et al 2025 how
ever even though it is easy to agree with an argument
that more empirical research is needed on incident man
agement in general tndel et al 2014 a problem with
the nis2s largescale incidents is that thus far at least
10
publicly disclosed cases are missing in other words it is
difficult to properly evaluate a management of something
that has not supposedly yet happened in europe
therefore regarding empirical research it might make
sense to start from smaller evaluations in particular
3 the increased reporting obligations including the strict
deadlines would offer a good topic for empirical evalu
ation research a lot of research and other work have
also been done to help at evaluating the efficiency accu
racy and other aspects csirts and their incident manage
ment practices connell and waits 2013 dorofee et al
2007 among many others however a broader evalu
ation is required also with respect to eaies and others
who are obliged to report about incidents or do so volun
tarily given the cras and nis2s strict deadlines as
well as the penalties from noncompliance it may be that
organizations and others will report eagerly and possibly
incautiously thus the quality of early warnings inci
dents notifications and particularly final reports busetti
and scanni 2025 including a rate of false positives would
provide a good research topic with practical relevance a
related topic would involve examining whether reporting
guidelines and a systematic reporting format might in
crease reporting quality and reduce noise as it stands
neither the nis2 directive nor the other laws say anything
about what should be reported the topic is generally im
portant because regulatory obligations upon incident man
agement have recently been argued to work poorly in im
proving organizations cyber security postures patterson

reiterating that something should always be learned from
cyber security incidents and crises

1 Introduction
The internet has become a fundamental part of the modern society, tremendous amount of
valuable data and money are transferred through the internet, and cyber security is even more
important today than ever. To combat cyber threats, one of the emerging new methodology
is cyber threat hunting. Cyber Threat hunting is a proactive cyber defence activity. Instead
of waiting for the cyber threat to compromise the system, the cyber security personnel will
proactively hunt for the potential cyber threat. Although cyber threat hunting is practiced in
many companies, these companies are not yet satised with the eectiveness of cyber threat
hunting.
For cyber threat hunting, the most commonly known categories are: First, the data-driven
hunting, which is triggered by data observation [1][MJ18]; Second, the Intel-driven hunting,
identies threat intelligence information [2][Gao+20]; Third, the techniques, tactics, and proce-
dures, (TTP) driven hunting, searching for threat tactics, techniques and procedures.[3] [Ber+21]
Cyber threat huntingis used as baseline for next generation security operation center. [4][Bik+21]
Cyber threat hunting has also been used in industrial control systems. [5] [JL21][6][MG22]
1.1 Prior Research
In recent papers, we can see some new methods used for cyber threat hunting. There is a study
on evidence based classication method for cyber threat hunting by Matthew Beechey team.
[7][BKL21]
In the study of another team, Fengyu Yang team [8][Yan+22], cyber threat hunting is more
exible becuase their study is somewhat a hybrid cyber threat hunting.
The study of Abbas Yazdinejad team in 2022 [9][Yaz+22a], where a deep learning model is
used for cyber threat hunting in industrial internet. As we have seen in the paragraph above,
industrial internet is a major part of the cyber threat hunting.
In the 2021 paper by Renzheng Wei team, we see them using the method of neural network for
cyber threat hunting.[10][Wei+21]
Similarly, in the 2022 paper by Chung-Kuan Chen team, they inplement machine learning as a
way for cyber threat hunting.[11][Che+22]
1.2 Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to study existing studies of cyber threat hunting, and our goal
is to anaylyze these studies and nd the modern trend for cyber threat hunting. To better
illustrate this research, see Table 1.
1.3 Contribution and Layout
•This research is complementary to existing cyber hunting researches, and is meant to
provide some insights for other researchers looking into literature study of cyber threat
hunting.
•We identify 95 papers related to the study of cyber threat hunting, with the latest in year
2022.
•Then from these papers, we selected 25 essential papers for further in depth study, because
they meet with the keywords we set for these papers. And thus these papers can provide
essential; information in our comparative study.
3
•We will conduct a study of the data in these 25 papers.
•And we will provide a meta-analysis of the methods introduced in these papers.
In this research, we make presentations and provide a possible trend for future cyber hunting
studies.
Table 1: Research Questions
Research Questions Discussion
What are the latest cyber threat hunting methods? In this research, we
have observed data-
driven, Intel-driven
and TTP-driven.
How is cyber threat hunting used to improve cyber security? In this research, we
believe cyber threat
hunting can create se-
curity for industrial
networks, and possi-
bly provide a higher
level of security to
other elds.
What new methods are available for cyber threat hunting? In this research, we
have observed deep
learning, machine
learning and neural
network used for
cyber threat hunting.

2 Research Methodology
To achieve answer the research questions, we conduct the SLR. In this section, we discuss
the planning, conducting and reporting of the review in iterations to allow for a thorough
understanding of this SLR.
2.1 Selection of Primary Studies
The selection process involves using dierent searching strings in the dierent database plat-
forms. In our study, we used search string as ""cyber threat"", ""threat hunting"", ""data-driven"".
The platforms searched were:
- IEEE Xplore Digital Library
- ScienceDirect
- SpringerLink
- ACM Digital Library
- Google Scholar
The searches were run against the title of Cyber Threat Hunting, keywords or abstract, de-
pending on dierent databases. All these searches were conducted on 15th October 2022, and
we processed all recent studies in the databases that were published before this date. Then we
lter all the papers we found in these databases through our inclusion/exclusion criterias.
2.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Studies to be included in this SLR must report empirical methodology of cyber-threat hunting
and could be papers on case studies, new technology and commentaries on the development
of existing Cyber-threat hunting methods such as data-driven or Intel-driven. They must be
peer-reviewed and written in English.
Table 2: Inclusion and Exclusion criteria
Inclusion Exclusion
Paper shows empirical use of method. Paper focuses on cy-
ber threat.
Paper contains information of threat hunting. Data log of informa-
tion
Paper is written in English. Paper not in English.
2.3 Selection Results
There were a total of 937 studies identied from the initial keyword searches on the selected
platforms. Then we excluded the ones that do not meet our need for this research. We get a
total of 30 papers. After which we selected 25 from the 30 viable papers.
2.4 Quality Assessment
An assessment of the quality of primary studies was made according to the guidance.
Stage 1: Cyber Threat hunting, the paper must be on the subject of threat hunting or empha-
sizing a method for threat hunting.
Stage 2: Context, how the cyber threat hunting method is utilized in this paper.
Stage 3: Method Application, if this method is one of the new methods or the traditional.

Table 3: Excluded Papers
Checklist for Stages Excluded Studies
Stage 1 Cyber Threat Hunting [26][Wan+22]
Stage 2 Context [27][Yaz+22b]
Stage 3 Method Application [28][Rad+21]
Stage 4 Threat type [29][Mav+21]
Stage 5 Data reliability [30][Tro20]
Stage 4: Threat type, if this paper provides enough information about the cyber threat.
Stage 5: Data reliability, if the data is reliable
In this way, we can make sure this research is more eective and all the data that we extract
from the papers are reliable enough for further analysis.
2.5 Data Extraction
All the papers in the reference have now passed the quality assessment, so now we extract all
their study data from their papers, and we can divide the study data into these categories.
Context data: Information about the purpose of the study.
Qualitative data: Findings and conclusions provided by the authors.
Quantitative data: When applied to the study, data observed by experimentation and research.
2.6 Data Analysis
To meet the objective of answering the research questions, we compiled the data held within the
qualitative and quantitative data categories. And we conducted a meta-analysis of the papers.
Figure 1: Paper Through Processing

2.6.1 Publication over time
The numbers of publication is increasing over the years. There was only 3 during 2018-2019.
Another 5 during 2019-2020 and 7 during 2020-2021. And There were 10 between 2021-2022.
So we can envision there to be way more study in this area.

2.6.2 Signicant Keyword Count
In order to summarize all these papers, we decide to conduct a keyword search to nd the most
common themes among these papers. And obviously, Cyber threat and threat hunting were the
top of the table.

3 Findings
Each primary research paper was read in full and relevant qualitative and quantitative data was
extracted and summarized in [Table 5-13]. All primary studies focuses on the application and
dierent methods of cyber threat hunting. The focus of all papers is recorded below in [Table
5-13].
Each paper's theme and focus was further grouped into ve primary categories, Machine Learn-
ing, TTP, Data, Intel and Neural Network.
Studies that had a focus concerning deep learning, grouped together into the machine learning
category.
Figure 3 shows the percentages of dierent themes of the 25 primary studies, all of these have
passed the quality assessment to be included in the data analysis. The Most common themes
identied in the primary studies are the studies of Machine Learning at 29 percent in the ap-
plication of Cyber Threat Hunting, and in most of these cases, the use of Deep Learning is the
focus. Tied in the rst place,the other most common theme of the studies is TTP, the analyses
of tactic , technique and procedure at 29 percent. Data is the third commonest theme at 17
percent, these are the most traditional studies of the cyber threat hunting. And one of these
studies is the hybrid study of combining data-driven with other focus dierent studies. Neural
Network and Intel-driven are tied as the fourth most common focus in these papers at 13 per-
cent. In a sense it is similar to Machine Learning but the focus is dierent.

4 Discussion
The initial research into Cyber Threat Hunting yields more insights into the general consensus
on the subject. A deeper look into the studies show that one of the major issues many cases
of cyber threat hunting has shown is the lack of eciency as such a hunting process is time
consuming and required human eort.
However, with recent developments in articial intelligence and potentially more open data bases
on these subjects, machine learning, deep learning and neural networking is becoming one of
the most common theme in these recent papers. As we can see in Figure 2 and Table 5-13,
the number of papers related to cyber threat hunting and machine learning is slowly but surely
increasing.
The researchers of these papers used established open source platforms, such as the open-source
Cyber Threat Intelligence (OSCTI) such as Case [2][Gao+20] and Case [20][Gao+21]. There
are several reasons for researcher to use such platforms. The OSCTI is about sharing intel on
cyber threats, therefore for the studies that focuses on intel-driven study, these open source
platform is most useful. Machine learning can also use open source platforms as we can see in
Case [19][Ara+22].
Deep learning and Machine Learning are used to create models for threat hunting, as we can
see in Case [6][MG22], Case [9][Yaz+22a],Case [11][Che+22]. The other papers build a machine
learning algorithm for decision making, in order to maximize the eciency of cyber threat hunt-
ing, as we can see in Case [13][KMV17], Case [22][HF20], and Case [21][RYP21], which also
leaned towards neural networking.
4.1 RQ1: What are the latest cyber threat hunting methods?
The latest cyber threat hunting methods are the uses of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and
Neural Networks. As we can see in Figure 3, and we can see a lot more about the latest cyber
threat hunting methods from Table 5-13.
Most recent methods includes Neural Networking such as Case [10][Wei+21] and Case[21][RYP21].
The far more popular new method is machine learning.
4.2 RQ2: How is cyber threat hunting used to improve cyber security?
In many ways, TTP is the best to explain why cyber threat hunting is used to improve cyber
security.
1, Blind spots in public data sources, as seen in Case[17].
2, Hypothesis of future cyber threat, as stated in Case[5], Case[12][Ajm+21], with TTP-driven
cyber threat hunting, the security can predict and prepare for potential threat before the system
is under attck.
4.3 RQ3: What new methods are available for cyber threat hunting?
According to the primary studies, we can see a rising trend of using hybrid types of cyber threat
hunting, by combining machine learning with TTP, the system will be more capable of predict-
ing how the cyber threat will attack.
The latest studies suggested that the most commonly accepted applications for machine learn-
ing/neural networking were as follow:
1, Machine Learning algorithm for Decision Making in the neural networking. As seen in Case
[6][MG22] , Case [11][Che+22] , Case[13][KMV17] and Case [21][RYP21] and [22][HF20].
2, Machine Learning analyzer, AS in Case [19][Ara+22].
3, Threat hunting model based on Machine Learning. Commonly seen in machine learning cases
such as Case [6][MG22], Case [9][Yaz+22a],Case [11][Che+22]

5 Future Research Directions of Cyber Threat Hunting
Based on the results of this literature analysis and our observations, we present the following
research directions that are worth further investigations.
Deep Learning and TTP
The hybrid study of TTP and Deep Learning, where the system will learn from Open Sources
Cyber Threats and project the future TTP for cyber threat hunting.
Neural Network
The neural network, which is linked commonly to the crafting of a machine learning algorithm
in order to create the clear decision making pathway for the neural networking system. Further
study could prove more ecient bsed on past ML models as seen in Case [21], Case [22].
Industrial ML
Machine Learning combined with industrial cyber security. This is a potential projection be-
cause most commonly known industrial cyber threat hunting are still based on classier which
s data-driven or TTP-driven as in Case [5]. By combining the machine learning methodology
into classier for industrial cyber threat hunting could greatly improve their eciency.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
This research has identied available recent research on how Cyber Threat Hunting can be used
to increase the level of security of all cyber networks.
The initial search identied 937 studies with the initial keyword search on all the selected
platforms. Those keywords includes Cyber Threat, Threat Hunting and TTP.
This reseach also highlighted potential future directions for research in the area.
Potential Research Agenda 1
The research concerning Deep Learning and TTP-driven Cyber threat hunting. With Deep
Learning, TTP can be so much more ecient.
Potential Research Agenda 2
The research into Neural Networking and creating models for Cyber Threat Hunting. It may
be possible to create a fully automated system for Cyber Threat Hunting. Case[10]
Potential Research Agenda 3
The research into Industrial Machine Learning. As we can see, industrial cyber security is the
most common theme in TTP-driven hunts. Case [5]

the internet has become a fundamental part of the modern society tremendous amount of
valuable data and money are transferred through the internet and cyber security is even more
important today than ever to combat cyber threats one of the emerging new methodology
is cyber threat hunting cyber threat hunting is a proactive cyber defence activity instead
of waiting for the cyber threat to compromise the system the cyber security personnel will
proactively hunt for the potential cyber threat although cyber threat hunting is practiced in
many companies these companies are not yet satised with the eectiveness of cyber threat
hunting
for cyber threat hunting the most commonly known categories are first the datadriven
hunting which is triggered by data observation 1mj18 second the inteldriven hunting
identies threat intelligence information 2gao20 third the techniques tactics and proce
dures ttp driven hunting searching for threat tactics techniques and procedures3 ber21
cyber threat huntingis used as baseline for next generation security operation center 4bik21
cyber threat hunting has also been used in industrial control systems 5 jl216mg22
11 prior research
in recent papers we can see some new methods used for cyber threat hunting there is a study
on evidence based classication method for cyber threat hunting by matthew beechey team
7bkl21
in the study of another team fengyu yang team 8yan22 cyber threat hunting is more
exible becuase their study is somewhat a hybrid cyber threat hunting
the study of abbas yazdinejad team in 2022 9yaz22a where a deep learning model is
used for cyber threat hunting in industrial internet as we have seen in the paragraph above
industrial internet is a major part of the cyber threat hunting
in the 2021 paper by renzheng wei team we see them using the method of neural network for
cyber threat hunting10wei21
similarly in the 2022 paper by chungkuan chen team they inplement machine learning as a
way for cyber threat hunting11che22

4 discussion
the initial research into cyber threat hunting yields more insights into the general consensus
on the subject a deeper look into the studies show that one of the major issues many cases
of cyber threat hunting has shown is the lack of eciency as such a hunting process is time
consuming and required human eort
however with recent developments in articial intelligence and potentially more open data bases
on these subjects machine learning deep learning and neural networking is becoming one of
the most common theme in these recent papers as we can see in figure 2 and table 513
the number of papers related to cyber threat hunting and machine learning is slowly but surely
increasing
the researchers of these papers used established open source platforms such as the opensource
cyber threat intelligence oscti such as case 2gao20 and case 20gao21 there
are several reasons for researcher to use such platforms the oscti is about sharing intel on
cyber threats therefore for the studies that focuses on inteldriven study these open source
platform is most useful machine learning can also use open source platforms as we can see in
case 19ara22
deep learning and machine learning are used to create models for threat hunting as we can
see in case 6mg22 case 9yaz22acase 11che22 the other papers build a machine
learning algorithm for decision making in order to maximize the eciency of cyber threat hunt
ing as we can see in case 13kmv17 case 22hf20 and case 21ryp21 which also
leaned towards neural networking
41 rq1 what are the latest cyber threat hunting methods
the latest cyber threat hunting methods are the uses of machine learning deep learning and
neural networks as we can see in figure 3 and we can see a lot more about the latest cyber
threat hunting methods from table 513
most recent methods includes neural networking such as case 10wei21 and case21ryp21
the far more popular new method is machine learning
42 rq2 how is cyber threat hunting used to improve cyber security
in many ways ttp is the best to explain why cyber threat hunting is used to improve cyber
security
1 blind spots in public data sources as seen in case17
2 hypothesis of future cyber threat as stated in case5 case12ajm21 with ttpdriven
cyber threat hunting the security can predict and prepare for potential threat before the system
is under attck
43 rq3 what new methods are available for cyber threat hunting
according to the primary studies we can see a rising trend of using hybrid types of cyber threat
hunting by combining machine learning with ttp the system will be more capable of predict
ing how the cyber threat will attack
the latest studies suggested that the most commonly accepted applications for machine learn
ingneural networking were as follow
1 machine learning algorithm for decision making in the neural networking as seen in case
6mg22  case 11che22  case13kmv17 and case 21ryp21 and 22hf20
2 machine learning analyzer as in case 19ara22
3 threat hunting model based on machine learning commonly seen in machine learning cases
such as case 6mg22 case 9yaz22acase 11che22
20
5 future research directions of cyber threat hunting
based on the results of this literature analysis and our observations we present the following
research directions that are worth further investigations
deep learning and ttp
the hybrid study of ttp and deep learning where the system will learn from open sources
cyber threats and project the future ttp for cyber threat hunting
neural network
the neural network which is linked commonly to the crafting of a machine learning algorithm
in order to create the clear decision making pathway for the neural networking system further
study could prove more ecient bsed on past ml models as seen in case 21 case 22
industrial ml
machine learning combined with industrial cyber security this is a potential projection be
cause most commonly known industrial cyber threat hunting are still based on classier which
s datadriven or ttpdriven as in case 5 by combining the machine learning methodology
into classier for industrial cyber threat hunting could greatly improve their eciency
21
6 conclusion and future work
this research has identied available recent research on how cyber threat hunting can be used
to increase the level of security of all cyber networks
the initial search identied 937 studies with the initial keyword search on all the selected
platforms those keywords includes cyber threat threat hunting and ttp
this reseach also highlighted potential future directions for research in the area
potential research agenda 1
the research concerning deep learning and ttpdriven cyber threat hunting with deep
learning ttp can be so much more ecient
potential research agenda 2
the research into neural networking and creating models for cyber threat hunting it may
be possible to create a fully automated system for cyber threat hunting case10
potential research agenda 3
the research into industrial machine learning as we can see industrial cyber security is the

Abstract —This paper concerns the security of the electric power
transmission grid facing the threat of malicious cyber-physical
attackers. We posit that there is no such thing as perfectly ef-
fective cyber-security. Rather, any cyber-security measure comes
with the possibility that a highly skilled attacker could (eventually
find a way to) bypass it. On these grounds, we formulate a tri-
level decision making problem seeking to co-optimize preventive
physical and cyber-security measures under uncertainty on the
ability of an exogenous cyber-physical attacker to overcome
the latter. Preventive physical security measures refer to the
ex-ante procurement of reserve capacity, which translates into
ramping restrictions in real-time. Cyber-security measures refer
to updating the firewall rules so as to impede an intruder from
taking over the cyber infrastructure of the grid and disconnecting
power generators and transmission branches. We adopt standard
assumptions to formalize the inner optimization problems corre-
sponding to the cyber-physical attacker and power grid operator
and focus on uncertainty management at the uppermost level
of the problem. Our findings establish that physical- and cyber-
security measures are non-exchangeable complements in keeping
the power grid operation secure.

Introduction
Advanced digital technology is vital for the functioning of
today’s electric power system. Indeed, the modern power grid
relies on its cyber sub-system for most monitoring, protection,
control and optimization functionalities and operates as a com-
plex cyber-physical system. This essential technology however
may also pose a severe vulnerability. The risk that a malicious
adversary may intentionally exploit the power grid’s cyber sub-
system so as to disrupt electricity supply has unfortunately
been validated in practice [1]. As a result electric power system
cyber-security is nowadays recognized as critical and there is
a growing development of standards, rules and regulations [2].
Related literature
The question of securing the grid operation while facing
the threat of an intelligent cyber-physical attacker is actively
pursued by the research community. Most research works rely
on multi-level optimization to explicitly model the interrelated
decisions of malicious cyber-physical attackers and power
grid so-called “defenders” ( i.e., planners and operators) [3].
Bi-level optimization problems are cast from the perspective
of a cyber-physical attacker seeking to optimize her attack
vector while explicitly accounting for the optimal reaction
of the power grid operator. Such models can be used in an
assessment context, so as to identify which vulnerabilities a
cyber-physical attacker could target to exploit. Tri-level prob-
lems are cast from the (preceding) perspective of a preventive
planner. The goal here is to identify preventive measures
to counteract a cyber-physical attacker’s optimal strategy, in
turn maximizing her own objective while anticipating the
grid operator’s reaction. He et al. [4] consider the problem
of facing a cyber-physical attacker capable of both injecting
false data and physically disconnecting transmission lines. An
innovative feature of this work is the allocation of Distributed
Generators (DGs) in the post-attack stage, translating mathe-
matically into binary variables at the lowest-level optimization
problem modeling power system operation. The considered
preventive measures only act on the physical infrastructure of
the grid by hardening transmission components. In contrast,
Lai et al. [5] focus on choosing cyber-security preventive
measures only. These authors address the problem of placing
firewalls so as to block unauthorized access to protection
relays that could be exploited by a cyber-physical attacker
seeking to cause a cascading failure. Qin et al. [6] also
consider the placement of firewalls to impede unauthorisedaccess to the grid’s relays. The novel feature of this work is the
consideration of detailed substation topologies. Both groups
of authors in [5] and [6] adopt the assumption that firewalls
are perfectly effective countermeasures, blocking any cyber-
physical attacker’s unauthorized access with certainty. While
such an assumption is quite common in the power system’s
literature, it may be regarded as questionable in the cyber-
security context. In practice, the capabilities of cyber-physical
attackers continuously evolve, cyber-security measures have
specific protection scopes, while yet undiscovered (a.k.a., zero-
day) vulnerabilities may always exist. In line with this, —hang
et al. [7] consider the problem of allocating cyber-security
devices that only reduce rather than completely eliminate the
probability of a successful cyber-physical attack against the
grid’s transmission branches.
Paper Scope & contributions
In this paper we also take the pragmatic viewpoint that cyber-
security measures should not be considered as 100% effective.
On this basis, we investigate the stakes for an integrated cyber-
physical risk management framework wherein (i) preventive
cyber-security measures are realistically considered to reduce
rather than eliminate the probability of a successful cyber-
physical attack, and (ii) the synergy with physical-security
measures is acknowledged. To do so, we formulate a tri-
level optimization problem seeking to choose in advance both
physical- and cyber-security preventive measures, subject to
uncertainty on the effectiveness of the latter. We model such
uncertainty by way of a probability distribution of exogenous
cyber-physical attackers differentiated in terms of their capa-
bility to overcome or not the cyber-security measures protect-
ing the power grid. Without loss in generality, we focus on
the particular threat posed by cyber-physical attackers seeking
to intrude into the power grid’s substations and disconnect
power generators and transmission branches ( i.e., lines and
transformers) so as to maximize operational costs, including
the cost associated to involuntary load shedding. Anticipating
such threat, a preventive planner may choose to update the
security rules of the firewalls protecting the grid’s substations
and/or to procure reserve that can be deployed in the aftermath
of a successful attack. To solve the resulting problem, under
standard assumptions, we rely on a modified version of the
classic Column & Constraint Generation (C&CG) algorithm
by [8]. Results obtained on two benchmark systems, namely
the 24-bus version of the IEEE Reliability Test System [9]
and the IEEE 118-bus system [10], showcase the complex
interrelations between physical- and cyber-security measures.

Problem description
We adopt a planning perspective and consider the problem
of protecting the electric power system operation against the
Bulk Power System Dynamics and Control - XII, June 2025, Sorrento, Italy
Fig. 1. Cyber-physical power grid security actors
threat of malicious cyber-physical attacks. Figure 1 illustrates
the independent decision-making actors involved in this prob-
lem.
The central actor is the cyber-physical attacker (a.k.a. attacker
for brevity) who may seek to compromise the functionalities of
the power grid’s cyber sub-system so as to disrupt electricity
supply. The left-most actor is the so-called cyber-physical
planner (a.k.a. planner for brevity). Anticipating the threat
posed by the cyber-physical attacker, she may act on (i) the
power grid’s cyber sub-system to ensure that it cannot be
breached in a way causing an unacceptable electricity supply
and/or (ii) the physical power grid so as to ensure that it can
maintain an acceptable electricity supply service in spite of the
maloperation of its cyber sub-system. Finally, the right-most
actor is the power grid operator (a.k.a. operator for brevity)
who, in the aftermath of any cyber-physical attack, must
operate the (possibly compromised) electric power system.
We explicitly acknowledge that cyber-security measures have
specific protection scopes and are also susceptible to unknown
vulnerabilities ( e.g., zero-day vulnerabilities), while the capa-
bilities of cyber-physical attackers are constantly evolving. In
short, with any cyber-security measure comes the risk that
a sufficiently capable cyber-physical attacker may still find
a way to compromise the protected functionality. To account
for this feature, we consider a discrete set of alternative cyber-
physical attackers differentiated in terms of available resources
(i.e., number of cyber sub-system components an attacker
can compromise) and capabilities to overcome the applicable
cyber-security measures. We further associate a probability
measure to this set so as to represent the threat landscape as a
probability distribution over credible cyber-physical attackers.
Any credible cyber-physical attacker is assumed to be an
independent decision-maker, choosing her attack vector upon
observing the active cyber- and physical- security measures
and while anticipating the optimal reaction of the power
grid operator. The corresponding decision-making problem
can be cast as a bi-level optimization problem. Similarly, the
cyber-physical planner is considered to be an independent
decision-maker choosing her risk management strategy while
anticipating the optimal reaction of each alternative cyber-
physical attacker. Under information symmetry assumptions,
the respective decision-making problem can be cast as a tri-level optimization problem under uncertainty.
We consider a set-up wherein cyber-physical attackers may
seek to intrude into digital substations1and disconnect power
generators and transmission lines so as to maximize the power
grid operational costs. These latter costs include generation
redispatching costs and costs of involuntary load shedding and
are determined as per the optimal reaction of the power grid
operator to the realized grid status. A cyber-physical attacker’s
strategy is constrained by a resource limit, specifying the num-
ber of substations she may simultaneously gain unauthorized
access into. Once infiltrating a substation, the cyber-physical
attacker can disconnect generators and transmission branches.
Anticipating this uncertain threat, a cyber-physical planner
may choose to update the rules of cyber-security devices
blocking unauthorized access (a.k.a., firewalls) to the grid’s
substations. Additionally, this actor should also choose the
system reserve capacity which constrains the redispatching of
generating units in real-time operation. The objective of the
cyber-physical planner is to jointly minimize the cost of base-
case operation ( i.e., generation dispatch) and cyber-physical
security measures ( i.e., of updating firewall rules and reserve
procurement) along with the expected cost of the power grid
operation ( i.e., expected generation redispatching and load
shedding).
Mathematical formulation
Relying on the DC power flow approximation to keep the
model of the grid physics linear, we express the trilevel
optimization problem of the cyber-physical planner as in (1
– 22).
The top row of the planner’s objective (1) includes all 1st-stage
costs, and specifically the cost of the pre-attack generation
dispatch, the cost of reserve procurement, and the cost of
mobilizing resources at the physical locations of the different
buses of the system to update the firewall rules (3rdterm).
These 1st-stage costs are to be jointly minimized along with
the expectation of the power grid operation cost over the
post-attacks states while facing the threat described as the
postulated set of cyber-physical attackers. The probability
weighted summation of these costs is as shown in the bottom
row of (1) and includes scenario-specific redispatching and
load shedding costs.
Inequality constraint (2) is a resource constraint limiting the
total number of firewalls that the cyber-physical planner can
update with new security rules in the considered lead-time.
Constraints (3,4) define the feasible region of the planner’s
generation variables, referring to the pre-attack dispatch and
1For ease of exposition, and without loss in generality, we henceforth
assume that any single bus corresponds to a distinct digital substation and
use the terms bus and substation interchangeably to describe the assumed
threat.

reserve capacity. Constraint (5) models the choice of where
to update firewall rules as a binary decision. The group of
constraints (6 – 8) enforces that the pre-attack dispatch implies
no loss of load and conforms to the branch thermal ratings as
per the DC power flow approximation. While the focus is on
the considered cyber-physical threat, this group of constraints
is included to ensure that reserve procurement is not unrealistic
with respect to the pre-attack operation of the system.
For any cyber-physical attacker i∈ A ∪ B the objective
function to be maximized is the cost of power grid opera-
tion, including attack-induced reserve deployment and load
shedding (9). Constraint (10) defines an attacker’s resources in
terms of the number of buses she may simultaneously infiltrate.
Inequality constraints (11) are only valid for so-called cyber-
physical attackers with basic capabilities and enforce that any
such actor may not infiltrate any bus that is protected by means
of updated firewall rules2. The choice to intrude into the cyber
sub-system of a specific bus is modeled through a binary
decision variable (12). Inequality constraints (13) link the sta-
tus of transmission branches and the potential intrusion of its
associated (“sending/receiving”) end-buses. Specifically, these
constraints enforce that a branch can only be disconnected
if the cyber-physical attacker has managed to successfully
intrude either its “sending” or “receiving” bus. We use binary
decision variables to model branch disconnection decisions
(14). Equality constraints (15) model the disconnection of the
generating units connected at a breached bus.
Expressions (16 – 22) model the operator’s reaction to the
realized attack and, under information symmetry assumptions,
the impact of the attack on the power grid operation cost.
Constraints (17,18) limit the reserve energy to be used by
the operator according to the capacity procured by the cyber-
physical planner and, of course, the connection status of the
respective unit. Equality constraints (19) express the nodal
power balance for the post-attack system state, featuring the
additional decision variables corresponding to the deployment
of reserve energy and the use of involuntary load shedding.
Notice here the product of the pre-attack dispatch decided
by the planner and the attacker’s decision to compromise the
concerned bus. In (20), the non-negative load shedding vari-
able is upper bounded by the respective nodal load demand.
Equality constraints (21) define the post-attack power flow
as the product of the branch disconnection variable and the
fraction of the voltage angle difference divided by the branch
reactance. Finally, inequalities (22) impose the branch thermal

cyber-physical measures is referred to as an attacker with advanced capabil-

Abstract —Cyber ranges mimic real-world cyber environments
and are in high demand. Before building their own cyber ranges,
organizations need to deeply understand what construction
supplies are available to them. A fundamental supply is the
cyber range architecture, which prompts an important research
question: Which cyber range architecture is most appropriate
for an organization’s requirements? To answer this question,
we propose an innovative framework to specify cyber range
requirements, characterize cyber range architectures (based on
our analysis of 45 cyber range architectures), and match cyber
range architectures to cyber range requirements.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Cyber range is an emerging technology that can aptly
leverage the dynamic and informative interactions between
attackers and defenders in cyberspace to mimic a real-world
cyber environment. As organizations across many industry
sectors have increased their technological and cyberspace foot-
print, their demand for cyber ranges have likewise increased.
While there are commercial cyber ranges, there is a lack of
treatment with scientific rigor, which is important because the
current design of cyber ranges are heuristic or experience-
based. As a consequence, customers have no choice but to
passively adopt what is offered by cyber range vendors.
In this paper, we advocate treating cyber range as a new
kind of cybersecurity instrument and studying it with scientific
rigor. This is important, for example, to help organizations
choose the most appropriate cyber ranges according to their
requirements, help organizations customize their own cyber
ranges, and provide significant insights into future cyber range
design and development.
Our Contributions . We make two contributions. First, we
formulate three research questions to guide the design of cyber
ranges: (i) How should we specify cyber range requirements?
(ii) How should we characterize cyber range architectures?
(iii) How should we map available cyber range architectures
to given cyber range requirements? Second, we propose an
innovative conceptual framework to systematically address
these research questions, by defining 22 attributes to specify
cyber range requirements, proposing six cyber range archi-
tectures, which we abstract from 45 real-world cyber rangearchitectures; and proposing an algorithm that matches cyber
range architectures to satisfy an organization’s needs.
Paper Outline . The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section II details the proposed framework. Section III reviews
related prior studies. Section IV concludes the paper.
II. T HEFRAMEWORK
As highlighted in Figure 1, our framework has three
components: (i) characterizing cyber range requirements; (ii)
characterizing cyber range architectures; and (iii) designing an
algorithm to match cyber range architectures to cyber range
requirements. These components are elaborated below.

A. Characterizing Cyber Range Requirements
Cyber range demand varies greatly in terms of organiza-
tions’ requirements. For example, we see a preponderance of
cyber ranges created for cybersecurity training purposes [1]–
[5] and for testing cyber-physical systems [6]–[8]. There are
many additional use cases (such as leveraging cyber ranges
as an instrument for conducting cybersecurity research) that
highlight the need to accurately characterize cyber range re-
quirements. Fig. 2 outlines the three requirement sets, namely
purpose ,scope , and constraints , with their associated attributes
highlighted in Table I and elaborated below.
Requirement 1: Purpose . This requirement describes the
context for utilization of the cyber range and expresses its
objectives in the following attributes.
•Employment : This attribute captures the overall opera-
tional purpose of the cyber range. For example, several
commercial vendors, such as Offensive Security, offer
certifications through their cyber range scenarios. In this
case, the purpose is to evaluate and certify candidates.
•Sector : This attribute identifies the sector of coverage for
the cyber range, especially what types of objectives the

cyber range will be used for (e.g., academic requirements
can differ greatly from military ones).
•Teaming : This attribute identifies the participants and
describes the attack-defense interactions between them.
Many publicly available cyber range scenarios, such as
PicoCTF and Root-Me, focus almost exclusively on the
red (i.e., attacker) team, while a few others focus on blue
(i.e., defender) team training. However, there is a growing
demand to mimic the complex interactions of both teams.
•Scoring : This attribute identifies how user activity in the
cyber range will be scored. This is particularly impor-
tant for assessing the capabilities of red and blue team
members for real-world cyber environments.
•Tutoring : This attribute specifies the sophistication of the
instructional function of the range. This is particularly
relevant to education- and training-oriented cyber ranges.
Requirement 2: Scope . This requirement describes the extent
of functionality and usage of the cyber range. Deployment
size and complexity can vary significantly. For example, the
Kypo Cyber Range Platform can facilitate hundreds of users,
while the Kypo Cyber Sandbox Creator is for a single user via
low-resourced virtual machines (VM) [1]. This requirement is
characterized by the following attributes.
•Domain : This attribute describes the application domain
to mimic, e.g., IT versus OT networks.
•Federation : This attribute describes the required integra-
tion with other cyber ranges, such as integrating cyber
ranges into a European cyber range ecosystem [9].
•Concurrency : This attribute describes the average concur-
rent user usage (e.g., a cyber range may be designed for
use by 10 users at the same time [10]).
•Connectivity : This attribute describes the methods of user
connectivity (e.g., users may require local on-site access
to a cyber range vs. remote access via a gateway).
•Fidelity : This attribute is the degree of exactness of
the cyber range to real-world systems and networks,
measured by the average ratio of simulation to emula-
tion employed. Simulation is a higher abstraction of the
entity mimicked which only captures specific properties
desired, while emulation mimics a more substantial set
of properties, representing the entity more fully.•Duration : This attribute is the continuous deployment
duration required. For example, NATO’s cyber range for
Locked Shields requires more than 30 days in duration,
even though the exercise completes in two days [11].
•Availability : This attribute describes the user time usage
regime, such as whether cyber range scenarios will be
deployed on-demand or will be continuously available.
•Retention : This attribute is the required duration of cyber
range scenario data retention (e.g., a research-oriented
cyber range scenario may require 6 months of retention
to facilitate research investigations).
•Integration : This attribute identifies the internal integra-
tion between scenarios (e.g., two red team scenarios may
integrate into a new complex blue team defense scenario).
•Updateability : This attribute is the degree of planned up-
dates to the infrastructure and scenario sets. For example,
one cyber range design may require incremental updates
to ensure its relevance to smart campus [12].
•Scalability : This attribute is the degree of planned in-
crease in purpose and scope, where the degree is mea-
sured as the average increase across the range of values
ofpurpose andscope attributes.
Requirement 3: Constraints . This requirement describes con-
straints imposed on the cyber range designer and are associated
with the attributes of purpose andscope requirements.
•Budget : This attribute is the annual monetary funds
available for construction, lifecycle, and maintenance.
•Build Speed : This attribute is the specified average maxi-
mum time allowed to provision and deploy a cyber range,
and/or its scenario set.
•Latency : This attribute is the average permissible network
and system delay time in the cyber range.
•Staff : This attribute is the number of full-time per-
sonnel available to support administration and sched-
uled/unscheduled maintenance.
•Physical : This attribute is the non-contiguous physical
space available to house and facilitate scenarios.
•Security : This attribute describes the level of data and
process protection required to secure the cyber range
itself and to mitigate the potential damages or attacks
that may originate from the cyber range against others.
Given the preceding set of 22 attributes, where each can take
multiple values, there are many combinations of cyber range
characteristics. This means that it is not feasible to manually
characterize these numerous combinations.
B. Characterizing Cyber Range Architectures
Defining Cyber Range Architectures. From our study of 45
architectures discussed in the literature, ranging from federated
enterprise business [9], to space satellite [13], to maritime
systems [5], we define architectures (as depicted in Fig. 1)
to systematically describe the design of cyber ranges.
We note that cyber ranges are typically defined by their
functionality. Hence, functional architecture sits at the top of
the framework. Users interact with the cyber range at this layer.

Thefunctional architecture describes the runtime environment,
where assets are deployed to perform their functions (e.g., se-
curity, network, storage) and integrate with each other across a
cyber range. It also describes management functions (typically
found in the cantonment area of a cyber range) that allows
for the deployment, maintenance, and customization of portals
(i.e., user interfaces), user roles (i.e., access and permissions),
environment resources (e.g., memory, storage), monitoring
(e.g., network traffic), and the scenario lifecycle (i.e., creation,
modification, deployment, generation, and execution).
At the next layer, capabilities describes the tools that enable
the use and functionality of a cyber range. One difference of
the cyber domain from the kinetic domain is that capabilities
often come in the form of software. We cataloged 350 tools,
including cybersecurity tools, and gained the following insight:
Insight 1: Most free/publicly available cybersecurity tools
(205 of 241) are for offensive or forensics purposes.
Insight 1 makes sense as vendors have financial incentives to
produce commercial defensive risk and incident management
tools. By contrast, most commercial companies are not paying
for offensive cyber capabilities nor technical forensics tools.
The logical topology describes the various networks that
support the administration and scenario deployment of the
cyber range including the degree of cloud employment. In ex-
ploring potential topologies, we gained the following insight:
Insight 2: Within a highly managed cyber range, administra-
tive data and processes will likely interfere with the objectivesof high fidelity scenarios (e.g., experiments and certification).
Insight 2 emphasizes that highly managed cyber ranges
have sensors deployed across the cyber range for management,
monitoring, and security, which cyber range scenario develop-
ers must account for. These hardware and software sensors, as
well as the data and traffic they collect, can introduce foreign
artifacts that, for example, could corrupt the control group of
an experiment, or pollute the exam network of a certification.
Lastly, the structure defines the physical components of
the cyber range. Modern hardware systems are complicated
to configure and ensure compatibility, as well as expensive
to procure, maintain, and replace. Hence, organizations must
exercise significant foresight in structure design.
Designing Reference Architectures . We propose six refer-
ence architectures. What are common to these architectures
include: (i) each architecture contains a cantonment cluster
responsible for management and administration of the cyber
range; (ii) each cantonment cluster can leverage similar tools to
enable their management capabilities (e.g., syslog for monitor-
ing); and (iii) a DMZ is used as an example security implemen-
tation, which is replaceable with other security approaches.
Reference Architecture 1: Pure Physical . The defining charac-
teristic of this architecture is that all systems and appliances
are physically the same as their real-world counterparts that
they intend to mimic. Its capabilities are also the same in
this regard (e.g., routing and segmentation are accomplished
via physical network appliances). Fig. 3 depicts a logical
topology and structure with typical use cases directly relatable
to physical devices. The enterprise network clusters illustrate
the potentially high resource demands of this architecture.

Reference Architecture 2: Centrally Virtualized . This architec-
ture emphasizes virtualization technology over physical de-
vices, significantly decreasing the complexity of the structure.
Hence, tools like Xen Server, KVM, and VirtualBox are key
capabilities to provide very high fidelity emulation. Fig. 4
depicts the logical/physical topology where entire enterprise
network clusters are virtualized within a server stack, as well
as all cantonment cluster functionalities.

(e.g., PetaSAN and XCP-ng) to enable storage pooling and virtualization.
Reference Architecture 3: On-Premise Cloud . Cloud properties
(e.g., self service capable, resource pooling, rapidly elastic)
make this architecture distinct, while its logical/physical topol-
ogy is quite similar to Fig. 4 because private clouds are enabled
by virtualization (e.g., via XCP-ng). Openstack is the main
capability to create a private cloud. However, this comes with
immense complexity, comprising of over 30 services, countless
configurations files, and at least a dozen nodes.
Reference Architecture 4: Public Cloud . The public cloud
approach benefits from cloud properties while offloading cloud
maintenance tasks to third parties that have seemingly limitless
resources (e.g., compute), though at a price. Further, the
management plane provides robust and mature capabilities. It
also natively supports automation tools like Terraform, though
core cloud capabilities are proprietary. Its topology is also
similar to Fig. 4, except it resides outside the organization.
Reference Architecture 5: Distributed Virtualization . This ap-
proach emphasizes the use of remote physical nodes (e.g.,
end-user desktops) to house cyber range scenarios. While a
cantonment cluster centrally manages the overall cyber range,
more control resides with the end-user (i.e., root user of the
desktop). Fig. 5 illustrates the logical/physical topology. A
use case is a classroom of students who only interact with
a few VMs in simple scenarios. Virtualization, micro-cloud,
containerization, and automation tools such as VirtualBox,
MicroStack, Docker, and Vagrant are key capabilities.

resource remote nodes can host VMs, containers, and/or micro-clouds.Reference Architecture 6: Hybrid . This architecture leverages
the strengths and capabilities of the other approaches, bringing
them together into a single architecture of varying densities.
Fig. 6 depicts the architecture where: a public cloud hosts
low-resourced, non-persistent VMs (decreasing subscription
cost); a private cloud hosts persistent, data-rich, and heavy
workload scenarios (leveraging cloud properties, e.g., resource
pooling); an on-premise centrally virtualized environment han-
dles medium persistent workloads (decreasing staffing cost);
distributed virtualization facilitates light persistent scenar-
ios (decreasing cost and administration); and an on-premise
physical network supports cyber-physical testing (supporting
required objectives). However, this approach has the drawback
of increasing the overall complexity of the architecture.

Through our design of the six reference architectures, we
gained the following insight:
Insight 3: It is best to employ well-maintained infrastructure
capabilities and not inject custom code patching.
Insight 3 speaks to the complexity of cyber range infras-
tructures. Well-supported hardware and software capabilities
(i.e., by regularly issued vendor patches) allow the cyber
range to grow and mature with new innovations. Conversely,
customizing cyber range deployments by directly patching
code (e.g., in the XCP-ng codebase) has a greater risk of
breaking functionality and snowballing overhead requirements.
Defining Metrics to Characterize Cyber Range Architec-
tures . Appropriate characterization of cyber range architec-
tures prior to technical design and procurement saves money
and time. This prompts us to define four categories of metrics
in light of the requirement attributes we have discussed.
Metric Category 1: Scope . In consideration of the scope of
the cyber range demand, we define two metrics. Extensibility
is the degree of ability to shift across the possible values of
the various scope requirement attributes (e.g., from a pure IT
enterprise domain to cyber-physical). Capacity is the degree
of ability to achieve the highest value levels across the various
scope requirement attributes (e.g., >1,000concurrent users).
Metric Category 2: Performance . Concerning the performance
of the cyber range, we define two metrics. Build Speed is the
amount of time (in seconds, minutes, or hours) it takes to
provision and deploy a scenario set. Latency is the amount of
average network and system delay time (in milliseconds).
Metric Category 3: Cost . Likewise, the cost of the cyber range
is defined in two metrics. Budget is the amount of annual
monetary funds required to construct and maintain the cyber
range. Staff is the number of personnel required to support
administration and maintenance of the cyber range.
Metric Category 4: Security . We propose using standard
security metrics: confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-
repudiation, authenticity, and privacy.
Analyzing Reference Architectures . We apply these metrics
at the ordinal scale and qualitatively via a Likert Scale
approach [14]. We compare the reference architectures (of a
sizeable deployment) to an average cyber range deployment
scenario (i.e., to a medium-sized organization’s enterprise
business environment). Table II summarizes our analysis,
enumerating our qualitative results and the significant strengths
and weaknesses of each architecture per metric category.
C. Matching Cyber Range Architectures to Requirements
Building a Matching Dataset . This dataset contains the
matching of each requirement attribute to each of the six archi-
tectures. We make the following definitions: (i) Supportability :
the level of ability a reference architecture is able to facilitate a
requirement attribute. (ii) Significance : the level of importance
of a requirement attribute given its value (e.g., significance of
abudget value of low is different than medium ). We apply
our domain expertise to assess supportability by qualitatively
scoring each architecture per attribute, and significance by
providing weights for each attribute per value (where the
range of values are enumerated in Table I). We then store
the resulting dataset as a CSV with the following columns: (i)
attribute name ; (ii) attribute value ; (iii) attribute weight : the
weight assigned to the attribute value; (iv) architecture scores :
for the remaining six columns, the assigned supportability
score for each reference architecture.
Automating the Matching Process . We automate the match-
ing process (as depicted in Fig 1) via a python script that
ingests the matching dataset and requirements of interest. It
outputs a score for each reference architecture, along with a
heat map to visualize and explain the score. At a high level, the
score reflects to what extent an architecture satisfies the given
cyber range requirements; the architecture with the highest
score can be used to build a cyber range. Core functions of
the script are given below:
1def score_lookup(user_input, matching_dataset):
2 for key, value inuser_input:
3 select line from matching_dataset where
(attribute == key and value == value) ,→
4 append line to score_lookup_df
5return score_lookup_df
6def score_calculation(score_lookup_df):
7 for architecture column inscore_lookup_df:
8 append sum(score_looup_df.weight *
architecture.score) to architecture_scores_df ,→
9return architecture_scores_df
The score lookup function retrieves the applicable CSV
line from the matching dataset for every requirement at-
tribute value selected by the user and provides it to thescore calculation function, which computes the score for
each reference architecture by summing the products of each
requirement attribute value’s weight and architecture score. It
outputs the score totals and provides this computed data to a
heat map generation function.
Fig. 7. Heat map depicting a sample result, where the hybrid architecture
is recommended especially because of the strong match in terms of domain,
availability, retention, scalability, and latency requirements.
Fig. 7 shows a sample output with reference architectures
indicated in the y-axis and requirement attributes indicated in
thex-axis. At a high level, the heat map provides explainability
to the result by visualizing how requirements have impacted
the selection of reference architectures.
III. R ELATED WORK
We divide related prior studies into three categories. First,
to catalog cyber ranges, there are studies on characterizing
cyber range functions [15], [16], on conducting questionnaire-
based survey of cyber range components and tools [17], on
recommending cyber ranges according to objectives [18], and
on summarizing cyber range infrastructures and capture-the-
flag environments [19]. The present study goes much beyond
these studies in terms of comprehensiveness, especially con-
cerning architectures. Second, there are studies on creating and
managing cyber ranges [20], on modeling and detecting flaws
in cyber range-based training [21], on qualitatively analyzing a
particular cyber range [22], and on assessment methodologies
for cybersecurity training platforms [23]. The present study
goes beyond them by proposing a systematic set of attributes
and metrics (e.g., extensibility and capacity) for assessing
and characterizing cyber range architectures. Third, there are
studies on extending on-premise cyber ranges to public [24]
and private cloud infrastructures [25], and on combining
virtualized and physical devices into a hybrid cyber range [26].
The present study goes beyond these studies by proposing a
systematic set of cyber range reference architectures.
IV. C ONCLUSION FOR FUTURE WORK
We have presented a framework for specifying cyber range
requirements, characterizing cyber range architectures, and
matching cyber range architectures to requirements. This study
represents a significant first step towards automating the design
of cyber ranges according to requirements.
The present study has several limitations which need to be
addressed in the future. First, the matching algorithm heavily
relies on our domain expertise; a more intelligent algorithm

the reference architectures; future study needs to incorporate
quantitative metrics (e.g., [27]–[32]). Third, we focused on
assessing general reference architectures; we want to explore
more industry- and sector-specific architectures in the future.

abstract cyber ranges mimic realworld cyber environments
and are in high demand before building their own cyber ranges
organizations need to deeply understand what construction
supplies are available to them a fundamental supply is the
cyber range architecture which prompts an important research
question which cyber range architecture is most appropriate
for an organizations requirements to answer this question
we propose an innovative framework to specify cyber range
requirements characterize cyber range architectures based on
our analysis of 45 cyber range architectures and match cyber
range architectures to cyber range requirements
index terms cyber range architecture requirements metrics
i i ntroduction
cyber range is an emerging technology that can aptly
leverage the dynamic and informative interactions between
attackers and defenders in cyberspace to mimic a realworld
cyber environment as organizations across many industry
sectors have increased their technological and cyberspace foot
print their demand for cyber ranges have likewise increased
while there are commercial cyber ranges there is a lack of
treatment with scientific rigor which is important because the
current design of cyber ranges are heuristic or experience
based as a consequence customers have no choice but to
passively adopt what is offered by cyber range vendors
in this paper we advocate treating cyber range as a new
kind of cybersecurity instrument and studying it with scientific
rigor this is important for example to help organizations
choose the most appropriate cyber ranges according to their
requirements help organizations customize their own cyber
ranges and provide significant insights into future cyber range
design and development
our contributions  we make two contributions first we
formulate three research questions to guide the design of cyber
ranges i how should we specify cyber range requirements
ii how should we characterize cyber range architectures
iii how should we map available cyber range architectures
to given cyber range requirements second we propose an
innovative conceptual framework to systematically address
these research questions by defining 22 attributes to specify
cyber range requirements proposing six cyber range archi
tectures which we abstract from 45 realworld cyber rangearchitectures and proposing an algorithm that matches cyber
range architectures to satisfy an organizations needs
paper outline  the rest of the paper is organized as follows
section ii details the proposed framework section iii reviews
related prior studies section iv concludes the paper

a characterizing cyber range requirements
cyber range demand varies greatly in terms of organiza
tions requirements for example we see a preponderance of
cyber ranges created for cybersecurity training purposes 1
5 and for testing cyberphysical systems 68 there are
many additional use cases such as leveraging cyber ranges
as an instrument for conducting cybersecurity research that
highlight the need to accurately characterize cyber range re
quirements fig 2 outlines the three requirement sets namely
purpose scope  and constraints  with their associated attributes
highlighted in table i and elaborated below
requirement 1 purpose  this requirement describes the
context for utilization of the cyber range and expresses its
objectives in the following attributes
employment  this attribute captures the overall opera
tional purpose of the cyber range for example several
commercial vendors such as offensive security offer
certifications through their cyber range scenarios in this
case the purpose is to evaluate and certify candidates
sector  this attribute identifies the sector of coverage for
the cyber range especially what types of objectives the

cyber range will be used for eg academic requirements
can differ greatly from military ones
teaming  this attribute identifies the participants and
describes the attackdefense interactions between them
many publicly available cyber range scenarios such as
picoctf and rootme focus almost exclusively on the
red ie attacker team while a few others focus on blue
ie defender team training however there is a growing
demand to mimic the complex interactions of both teams
scoring  this attribute identifies how user activity in the
cyber range will be scored this is particularly impor
tant for assessing the capabilities of red and blue team
members for realworld cyber environments
tutoring  this attribute specifies the sophistication of the
instructional function of the range this is particularly
relevant to education and trainingoriented cyber ranges
requirement 2 scope  this requirement describes the extent
of functionality and usage of the cyber range deployment
size and complexity can vary significantly for example the
kypo cyber range platform can facilitate hundreds of users
while the kypo cyber sandbox creator is for a single user via
lowresourced virtual machines vm 1 this requirement is
characterized by the following attributes
domain  this attribute describes the application domain
to mimic eg it versus ot networks
federation  this attribute describes the required integra
tion with other cyber ranges such as integrating cyber
ranges into a european cyber range ecosystem 9
concurrency  this attribute describes the average concur
rent user usage eg a cyber range may be designed for
use by 10 users at the same time 10
connectivity  this attribute describes the methods of user
connectivity eg users may require local onsite access
to a cyber range vs remote access via a gateway
fidelity  this attribute is the degree of exactness of
the cyber range to realworld systems and networks
measured by the average ratio of simulation to emula
tion employed simulation is a higher abstraction of the
entity mimicked which only captures specific properties
desired while emulation mimics a more substantial set
of properties representing the entity more fullyduration  this attribute is the continuous deployment
duration required for example natos cyber range for
locked shields requires more than 30 days in duration
even though the exercise completes in two days 11
availability  this attribute describes the user time usage
regime such as whether cyber range scenarios will be
deployed ondemand or will be continuously available
retention  this attribute is the required duration of cyber
range scenario data retention eg a researchoriented
cyber range scenario may require 6 months of retention
to facilitate research investigations
integration  this attribute identifies the internal integra
tion between scenarios eg two red team scenarios may
integrate into a new complex blue team defense scenario
updateability  this attribute is the degree of planned up
dates to the infrastructure and scenario sets for example
one cyber range design may require incremental updates
to ensure its relevance to smart campus 12
scalability  this attribute is the degree of planned in
crease in purpose and scope where the degree is mea
sured as the average increase across the range of values
ofpurpose andscope attributes
requirement 3 constraints  this requirement describes con
straints imposed on the cyber range designer and are associated
with the attributes of purpose andscope requirements
budget  this attribute is the annual monetary funds
available for construction lifecycle and maintenance
build speed  this attribute is the specified average maxi
mum time allowed to provision and deploy a cyber range
andor its scenario set
latency  this attribute is the average permissible network
and system delay time in the cyber range
staff  this attribute is the number of fulltime per
sonnel available to support administration and sched
uledunscheduled maintenance
physical  this attribute is the noncontiguous physical
space available to house and facilitate scenarios
security  this attribute describes the level of data and
process protection required to secure the cyber range
itself and to mitigate the potential damages or attacks
that may originate from the cyber range against others
given the preceding set of 22 attributes where each can take
multiple values there are many combinations of cyber range
characteristics this means that it is not feasible to manually
characterize these numerous combinations
b characterizing cyber range architectures
defining cyber range architectures from our study of 45
architectures discussed in the literature ranging from federated
enterprise business 9 to space satellite 13 to maritime
systems 5 we define architectures as depicted in fig 1
to systematically describe the design of cyber ranges
we note that cyber ranges are typically defined by their
functionality hence functional architecture sits at the top of
the framework users interact with the cyber range at this layer

thefunctional architecture describes the runtime environment
where assets are deployed to perform their functions eg se
curity network storage and integrate with each other across a
cyber range it also describes management functions typically
found in the cantonment area of a cyber range that allows
for the deployment maintenance and customization of portals
ie user interfaces user roles ie access and permissions
environment resources eg memory storage monitoring
eg network traffic and the scenario lifecycle ie creation
modification deployment generation and execution
at the next layer capabilities describes the tools that enable
the use and functionality of a cyber range one difference of
the cyber domain from the kinetic domain is that capabilities
often come in the form of software we cataloged 350 tools
including cybersecurity tools and gained the following insight
insight 1 most freepublicly available cybersecurity tools
205 of 241 are for offensive or forensics purposes
insight 1 makes sense as vendors have financial incentives to
produce commercial defensive risk and incident management
tools by contrast most commercial companies are not paying
for offensive cyber capabilities nor technical forensics tools
the logical topology describes the various networks that
support the administration and scenario deployment of the
cyber range including the degree of cloud employment in ex
ploring potential topologies we gained the following insight
insight 2 within a highly managed cyber range administra
tive data and processes will likely interfere with the objectivesof high fidelity scenarios eg experiments and certification
insight 2 emphasizes that highly managed cyber ranges
have sensors deployed across the cyber range for management
monitoring and security which cyber range scenario develop
ers must account for these hardware and software sensors as
well as the data and traffic they collect can introduce foreign
artifacts that for example could corrupt the control group of
an experiment or pollute the exam network of a certification
lastly the structure defines the physical components of
the cyber range modern hardware systems are complicated
to configure and ensure compatibility as well as expensive
to procure maintain and replace hence organizations must
exercise significant foresight in structure design
designing reference architectures  we propose six refer
ence architectures what are common to these architectures
include i each architecture contains a cantonment cluster
responsible for management and administration of the cyber
range ii each cantonment cluster can leverage similar tools to
enable their management capabilities eg syslog for monitor
ing and iii a dmz is used as an example security implemen
tation which is replaceable with other security approaches
reference architecture 1 pure physical  the defining charac
teristic of this architecture is that all systems and appliances
are physically the same as their realworld counterparts that
they intend to mimic its capabilities are also the same in
this regard eg routing and segmentation are accomplished
via physical network appliances fig 3 depicts a logical
topology and structure with typical use cases directly relatable
to physical devices the enterprise network clusters illustrate
the potentially high resource demands of this architecture

reference architecture 2 centrally virtualized  this architec
ture emphasizes virtualization technology over physical de
vices significantly decreasing the complexity of the structure
hence tools like xen server kvm and virtualbox are key
capabilities to provide very high fidelity emulation fig 4

network clusters are virtualized within a server stack as well

eg petasan and xcpng to enable storage pooling and virtualization
reference architecture 3 onpremise cloud  cloud properties
eg self service capable resource pooling rapidly elastic
make this architecture distinct while its logicalphysical topol
ogy is quite similar to fig 4 because private clouds are enabled
by virtualization eg via xcpng openstack is the main
capability to create a private cloud however this comes with
immense complexity comprising of over 30 services countless
configurations files and at least a dozen nodes
reference architecture 4 public cloud  the public cloud
approach benefits from cloud properties while offloading cloud
maintenance tasks to third parties that have seemingly limitless
resources eg compute though at a price further the
management plane provides robust and mature capabilities it
also natively supports automation tools like terraform though
core cloud capabilities are proprietary its topology is also
similar to fig 4 except it resides outside the organization
reference architecture 5 distributed virtualization  this ap
proach emphasizes the use of remote physical nodes eg
enduser desktops to house cyber range scenarios while a
cantonment cluster centrally manages the overall cyber range
more control resides with the enduser ie root user of the
desktop fig 5 illustrates the logicalphysical topology a
use case is a classroom of students who only interact with
a few vms in simple scenarios virtualization microcloud
containerization and automation tools such as virtualbox
microstack docker and vagrant are key capabilities

resource remote nodes can host vms containers andor microcloudsreference architecture 6 hybrid  this architecture leverages
the strengths and capabilities of the other approaches bringing
them together into a single architecture of varying densities
fig 6 depicts the architecture where a public cloud hosts
lowresourced nonpersistent vms decreasing subscription
cost a private cloud hosts persistent datarich and heavy
workload scenarios leveraging cloud properties eg resource
pooling an onpremise centrally virtualized environment han
dles medium persistent workloads decreasing staffing cost
distributed virtualization facilitates light persistent scenar
ios decreasing cost and administration and an onpremise
physical network supports cyberphysical testing supporting
required objectives however this approach has the drawback
of increasing the overall complexity of the architecture

fig 6 hybrid reference architecture incorporating other architectures
through our design of the six reference architectures we
gained the following insight
insight 3 it is best to employ wellmaintained infrastructure
capabilities and not inject custom code patching
insight 3 speaks to the complexity of cyber range infras
tructures wellsupported hardware and software capabilities
ie by regularly issued vendor patches allow the cyber
range to grow and mature with new innovations conversely
customizing cyber range deployments by directly patching
code eg in the xcpng codebase has a greater risk of
breaking functionality and snowballing overhead requirements
defining metrics to characterize cyber range architec
tures  appropriate characterization of cyber range architec
tures prior to technical design and procurement saves money
and time this prompts us to define four categories of metrics
in light of the requirement attributes we have discussed
metric category 1 scope  in consideration of the scope of
the cyber range demand we define two metrics extensibility
is the degree of ability to shift across the possible values of
the various scope requirement attributes eg from a pure it
enterprise domain to cyberphysical capacity is the degree
of ability to achieve the highest value levels across the various
scope requirement attributes eg 1000concurrent users
metric category 2 performance  concerning the performance
of the cyber range we define two metrics build speed is the
amount of time in seconds minutes or hours it takes to
provision and deploy a scenario set latency is the amount of
average network and system delay time in milliseconds
metric category 3 cost  likewise the cost of the cyber range
is defined in two metrics budget is the amount of annual
monetary funds required to construct and maintain the cyber
range staff is the number of personnel required to support
administration and maintenance of the cyber range
metric category 4 security  we propose using standard
security metrics confidentiality integrity availability non
repudiation authenticity and privacy
analyzing reference architectures  we apply these metrics
at the ordinal scale and qualitatively via a likert scale
approach 14 we compare the reference architectures of a
sizeable deployment to an average cyber range deployment
scenario ie to a mediumsized organizations enterprise
business environment table ii summarizes our analysis
enumerating our qualitative results and the significant strengths
and weaknesses of each architecture per metric category
c matching cyber range architectures to requirements
building a matching dataset  this dataset contains the
matching of each requirement attribute to each of the six archi
tectures we make the following definitions i supportability 
the level of ability a reference architecture is able to facilitate a
requirement attribute ii significance  the level of importance
of a requirement attribute given its value eg significance of
abudget value of low is different than medium  we apply
our domain expertise to assess supportability by qualitatively
scoring each architecture per attribute and significance by
providing weights for each attribute per value where the
range of values are enumerated in table i we then store
the resulting dataset as a csv with the following columns i
attribute name  ii attribute value  iii attribute weight  the
weight assigned to the attribute value iv architecture scores 
for the remaining six columns the assigned supportability
score for each reference architecture
automating the matching process  we automate the match
ing process as depicted in fig 1 via a python script that
ingests the matching dataset and requirements of interest it
outputs a score for each reference architecture along with a
heat map to visualize and explain the score at a high level the
score reflects to what extent an architecture satisfies the given
cyber range requirements the architecture with the highest
score can be used to build a cyber range core functions of
the script are given below
1def scorelookupuserinput matchingdataset
2 for key value inuserinput
3 select line from matchingdataset where
attribute  key and value  value 
4 append line to scorelookupdf
5return scorelookupdf
6def scorecalculationscorelookupdf
7 for architecture column inscorelookupdf
8 append sumscorelooupdfweight 
architecturescore to architecturescoresdf 
9return architecturescoresdf
the score lookup function retrieves the applicable csv
line from the matching dataset for every requirement at
tribute value selected by the user and provides it to thescore calculation function which computes the score for
each reference architecture by summing the products of each
requirement attribute values weight and architecture score it
outputs the score totals and provides this computed data to a
heat map generation function
fig 7 heat map depicting a sample result where the hybrid architecture
is recommended especially because of the strong match in terms of domain
availability retention scalability and latency requirements
fig 7 shows a sample output with reference architectures
indicated in the yaxis and requirement attributes indicated in
thexaxis at a high level the heat map provides explainability
to the result by visualizing how requirements have impacted
the selection of reference architectures
iii r elated work
we divide related prior studies into three categories first
to catalog cyber ranges there are studies on characterizing
cyber range functions 15 16 on conducting questionnaire
based survey of cyber range components and tools 17 on
recommending cyber ranges according to objectives 18 and
on summarizing cyber range infrastructures and capturethe
flag environments 19 the present study goes much beyond
these studies in terms of comprehensiveness especially con
cerning architectures second there are studies on creating and
managing cyber ranges 20 on modeling and detecting flaws
in cyber rangebased training 21 on qualitatively analyzing a
particular cyber range 22 and on assessment methodologies
for cybersecurity training platforms 23 the present study
goes beyond them by proposing a systematic set of attributes
and metrics eg extensibility and capacity for assessing
and characterizing cyber range architectures third there are
studies on extending onpremise cyber ranges to public 24
and private cloud infrastructures 25 and on combining
virtualized and physical devices into a hybrid cyber range 26
the present study goes beyond these studies by proposing a
systematic set of cyber range reference architectures
iv c onclusion for future work
we have presented a framework for specifying cyber range
requirements characterizing cyber range architectures and
matching cyber range architectures to requirements this study
represents a significant first step towards automating the design
of cyber ranges according to requirements
the present study has several limitations which need to be
addressed in the future first the matching algorithm heavily
relies on our domain expertise a more intelligent algorithm

ABSTRACT  
 
Cyber Security  plays an important role in the field of information technology  .Securing the information 
have become one of the biggest challenges in the present day. Wh en ever we think about the cyber 
security the first thing that comes to our mind is ‘cyber crimes’ which are increasing immensely day by 
day. Various Governments and companies are taking many measures in order to prevent these cyber 
crimes. Besides various  measures cyber security is still a very big concern to many. This paper mainly 
focuses  on challenges  faced by cyber security on the latest technologies  .It also  focuses on latest about 
the cyber security techniques , ethics  and the trends changing the face  of cyber security.  
 
Keywords: cyber security, cyber  crime,  cyber ethics, social media,  cloud computing,  android apps.  
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Today man is able to send and receive any form 
of data may be an e -mail or an audio or video 
just by the click of a b utton but did he ever 
think how securely his data id being transmitted 
or sent to the other person safely without any 
leakage of information?? The answer lies in 
cyber security. Today Internet is the fastest 
growing infrastructure in every day life.  In 
today’s technical environment many latest 
technologies are changing the face of the man 
kind. But due to these emerging technologies 
we are unable to safeguard our private 
information in a very effective way and hence 
these days cyber crimes are increasing da y by 
day. Today more than 60  percent of total 
commercial transactions are done online, so this 
field required a high quality of security for 
transparent and best transactions.  Hence cyber 
security has become a latest issue. The scope of 
cyber security is n ot just limited to securing the 
information in IT industry but also to various 
other fields like cyber space etc.  
 
 Even the latest technologies like cloud 
computing, mobile computing, E -commerce, net 
banking etc also needs high level of security. 
Since th ese technologies hold some important 
information regarding a person their security 
has become a must thing. Enhancing cyber  
security and protecting critical information 
infrastructures are essential to each nation's 
security and economic wellbeing. Making the 
Internet safer (and protecting Internet users) has 
become integral to the development of new services as well as governmental policy .   The 
fight against cyber crime needs a 
comprehensive  and a safer approach. Given that 
technical measures alone cannot  prevent any 
crime, it is critical that law enforcement 
agencies are allowed to investigate and 
prosecute cyber crime effectively . Today many 
nations and governments are imposing strict 
laws on cyber securities in order to prevent the 
loss of some importan t information.  Every 
individual must also be trained on this cyber 
security and save themselves from these 
increasing cyber crimes  
 
2. CYBER CRIME  
 
Cyber crime  is a term for any illegal activity that 
uses a computer as its primary means of 
commission  and t heft. The U.S. Department of 
Justice expands the definition of cyber crime  to 
include any illegal activity that uses a computer 
for the storage of evidence. The  growing list of 
cyber crimes  includes crimes that have been 
made possible by computers, such as  network 
intrusions and the dissemination of computer 
viruses, as well as computer -based variations of 
existing crimes, such as identity 
theft, stalking , bullying and  terrorism  which 
have become as major problem to people and 
nations. Usually in common man’s language 
cyber cr ime may be defined  as crime committed 
using a computer and the internet to steel a 
person’s identity or sell contraband or stalk 
victims or disrupt operations with malevolent 
programs. As day by day technology is playing 
in major role in a person’s life th e cyber crimes 
also will increase along with the technological 
advances.                                                                                               
3. CYBER SECURITY  
 
Privacy and security of the data will always be 
top security measures t hat any organization 
takes care. We are presently  living in a world 
where all the information is maintained in a 
digital or a cyber form. Social networking sites 
provide a space where users feel safe as they 
interact with friends and family. In the case of  
home users, cyber -criminals would continue to 
target social media sites to steal personal data . 
Not only social networking but also during bank 
transactions a person must take all the required 
security measures.

The above  Comparison of Cyber Security 
Incidents reported to Cyber999  in Malaysia  
from January –June 2012 and  2013 clearly 
exhibits the cyber security threats . As crime is 
increasing even the  security measures are also  
increasing. According to the survey of U.S. technology and healthcare executives 
nationwide, Silicon Valley Bank found that 
companies believe cyber attacks are a serious 
threat to both their data and their business 
continuity.  
 98% of companies are maintaining or 
increasing their cyber security 
resources and of those, half are 
increasing resources devoted to online 
attacks this year  
 The majority of companies are 
preparing for when, not if, cyber 
attacks occur  
 Only one -third   are c ompletely 
confident in the security of their 
information and   even less confident 
about the security mea sures of their 
business partners.  
 
There will be new attacks on Android operating 
system based d evices, but it will not be on 
massive scale. The fact ta blets share the same 
operating system as smart phones means they 
will be soon targeted by the same malware  as 
those platforms. The number of malware 
specimens for Macs would continue to grow, 
though much less than in the case of PCs. 
Windows 8  will allow u sers to develop 
applications for virtually any device (PCs, 
tablets and smart phones) running Windows 8, 
so it will be possible to develop malicious 
applications like those for Android , hence these 
are some of the predicted trends in cyber 
security.  
 
 
4. TRENDS CHANGING CYBER 
SECURITY  
 
Here mentioned below are some of the trends 
that are having a huge impact on cyber security.  
 
4.1 Web servers:  
 
The threat of attacks on web applications to 
extract data or to distribute malicious code 
persists. Cyber crimina ls distribute their 
malicious code via legitimate web servers 
they’ve compromised. But data -stealing attacks, 
many of which get the attention of media, are 
also a big threat.   Now, we  need a greater 
emphasis on protecting web servers and web 
applications.  Web servers are especially the best 
platform for these cyber criminals to steal the 
data. Hence one must always use a safer 
browser especially during important transactions 
in order not to fall as a prey for these crimes.  
 
4.2 Cloud computing and its serv ices 
 
These days all small, medium and large 
companies are slowly adopting cloud services. 
In other words the world is slowly moving 
towards the clouds . This latest trend pres ents a 
big challenge for cyber  security, as traffic can 
go around traditional poi nts of inspection. 
Additionally, as the number of applications 
available in the cloud grows, policy controls for 
web applications and cloud services will also 
need to evolve  in order to prevent the loss of 
valuable information. Though cloud services are 
developing their own models still a lot of issues 
are being brought up about their security. Cloud 
may provide immense opportunities but it 
should always be noted that as the cloud evolves 
so as its security concerns increase.  
4.3 APT’s and targeted attacks  
 
APT ( Advanced Persistent Threat) is a  whole 
new level of cyber crime ware . For years 
network security capabilities such as web 
filtering or IPS have played a key part in 
identifying such targeted attacks (mostly after 
the initial compromise). As attackers  grow 
bolder and employ more vague  techniques, 
network security must integrate with other 
security services  in order  to detect attacks.  
Hence one must improve our security techniques 
in order to prevent more threats coming in the 
future.  
 
4.4 Mobile Networ ks 
 
Today we are able to connect to anyone in any 
part of the world. But for these mobile networks 
security is a very big concern. These days 
firewalls and other security measures are 
becoming porous as people are using devices 
such as tablets, phones, PC’ s etc all of which 
again require extra securities apart from those 
present in the applications used. We must 
always think about the security issues of these 
mobile networks. Further mobile networks are 
highly prone to these cyber crimes a lot of care 
must be taken in case of their security issues.  
 
4.5 IPv6: New internet protocol  
 
IPv6 is the new Internet protocol which is 
replacing IPv4  (the older version), which has 
been a backbone of our networks in general and 
the Internet at large. Protecting IPv6 is n ot just a 
question of porting IPv4 capabilities. While 
IPv6 is a wholesale replacement in making more 
IP addresses available, there are some very 
fundamental changes to the protocol which need  to be considered in security policy.  Hence it is 
always better  to switch to IPv6 as soon as 
possible in order to reduce the risks regarding 
cyber crime.  
 
4.6 Encryption of the code  
 
Encryption  is the process of encoding messages 
(or information) in such a way that 
eavesdro ppers or hackers cannot read it. . In an  
encry ption scheme, the message or information 
is encrypted using an encryption algorithm, 
turning it into an unreadable  cipher text . This is 
usually done with the use of an  encryption key , 
which specifies how the message is to be 
encoded.  Encryption at a very beginning level 
protects data privacy and its integrity. But more 
use of encryption brings more c hallenges in 
cyber security . Encryption is also used to protect 
data in transit, for example data being 
transferred via  networks  (e.g. the  Internet , e-
commerce ), mobile telephones , wireless 
microphones , wireless intercom s etc. Hence by 
encrypting the code one can know if there is any  
leakage of information.  
 
Hence the above are some of the trends 
changing the face of cyber security in the world.  
The top network threats are  mentioned in below

                           Fig -1 
 
The above pie chart shows about the major 
threats for networks and cyber security.  
 
5. ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN 
CYBER SECURITY  
 
As we become more social in an increasingly 
connecte d world, companies must find new 
ways to protect personal information.  Social 
media plays a huge role in cyber security and 
will contribute a lot to personal cyber threats . 
Social  media adoption among personnel is 
skyrocketing and so is the threat of attac k. Since 
social media or social networking sites are 
almost used by most of them every day it has 
become a huge platform for the cyber criminals 
for hacking private information and stealing 
valuable data.  
 
In a world where we’re quick to give up our 
perso nal information, companies have to ensure 
they’re just as quick in identifying threats, 
responding in real time, and avoiding a breach 
of any kind.  Since people are easily attracted by 
these social media the hackers use them as a bait 
to get the informatio n and the data they require. 
Hence people must take appropriate measures 
especially in dealing with social media in order 
to prevent the loss of their information.  
The ability of individuals to share information 
with an audience of millions is at the heart  of the 
particular challenge that social media presents to 
businesses. In addition to giving anyone the 
power to disseminate commercially sensitive 
information, social media also gives the same 
power to spread false information, which can be 
just being as damaging. The  rapid spread of 
false information through social media is among 
the emerging risks identified  in Global Risks 
2013  report.  
Though social media can be used for cyber 
crimes these companies  cannot afford to stop 
using social media as it plays an important role 
in publicity of a company .  Instead, they must 
have solutions that will notify them of the threat 
in order to fix it before any real damage is done.  
However companies should understand  this and 
recognise the importance of analysing the 
information especially in social conversations 
and provide appropriate security solutions in 
order to stay away from risks. O ne must handle 
social media by using certain policies and right 
technologies.  
6. CYBER  SECURITY  TECHNIQUES  
6.1 Access control and password security  
The concept of user name and password has 
been fundamental way of protecting our 
information. This may be one of the first 
measures regarding cyber security.  
6.2 Authentication  of data  
The documents that we receive must always be 
authenticated be before downloading that is it should be checked if it has originated from a 
trusted and a reliable source and that they are 
not altered. Authenticating of these documents 
is usually done by the an ti virus software present 
in the devices. Thus a good anti virus software is 
also essential to protect the devices from viruses.  
6.3 Malware scanners  
This is software that usually scans all the files 
and documents present in the system for 
malicious code o r harmful viruses .  Viruses , 
worms, and Trojan horses are examples of 
malicious software that are often grouped 
together and referred to as malware.  
6.4 Firewalls  
A firewall is  a software program or piece of 
hardware that helps screen out hackers, viruses, 
and worms that try to reach your computer over 
the Internet.  All messag es entering or leaving 
the inter net pass through the firewall  present , 
which examines each message and blocks those 
that do not meet the specified  security  criteria . 
Hence firewalls play an important role in 
detecting the malware.  
6.5 Anti -virus software  
Antivirus software is a computer program t hat 
detects, prevents, and takes action to disarm or 
remove malicious software programs, such as 
viruses and worms. Most antivirus programs 
include an auto -update feature that enables the 
program to download profiles of new viruses so 
that it can check for  the new viruses as soon as 
they are discovered.   An anti virus software is a 
must and basic necessity for every system.  
 
Table II: Techniques on cyber security  
7 CYBER  ETHICS  
Cyber ethics are nothing but the code of the 
internet. When we practice these cyber ethics 
there are good chances of us using the internet 
in a proper and safer way. The below are a few 
of them:  
 DO use the Internet to communicate 
and interact with other people . Email 
and instant messaging make it easy to 
stay in touch with friends and family 
members, communicate with work 
colleagues, and share ideas and 
information with people across town or 
halfway around the world  
 Don’t be a bully on the Internet.  Do not 
call people names, lie about them, send 
embarrassing pictures of them, or do 
anything else to try to hurt them.   
 Internet is considered as world’s largest 
library with information on any topic in 
any subject area, so using this 
information in a cor rect and legal way 
is always essential.  
 Do not operate others accounts using 
their passwords.  
 Never try to send any kind of malware 
to other’s systems and make them 
corrupt.  
 Never share your personal information 
to anyone as there is a good chance of 
others misusing it and finally you 
would end up in a trouble.  
 When you’re online never pretend to 
the other person, and never try to create 
fake accounts on someone else as it 
would land you as well as the other 
person into trouble.  
 Always adhere to copyrighte d 
information and download games or 
videos only if they are permissible.  
The above are a few cyber ethics one must 
follow while using the internet.  We are always 
thought proper rules from out very early stages 
the same here we apply in cyber space.  
8. CONC LUSION  
Computer security is a vast topic that is 
becoming more important because the world is 
becoming highly interconnected, with networks 
being used to carry out critical transactions.  
Cyber crime continues to diverge down different 
paths with each New Y ear that passes  and so 
does the security of the information.  The latest 
and disruptive technologies, along with the new 
cyber tools and threats that come to light each day, are challenging organizations with not only 
how they secure their infra structure, b ut how 
they require  new platforms and intelligence to 
do so.  There is no perfect solution for cyber 
crimes but we should try our level best to 
minimize them in order to have a safe and 
secure future in cyber space.

3 cyber security  
 
privacy and security of the data will always be 
top security measures t hat any organization 
takes care we are presently  living in a world 
where all the information is maintained in a 
digital or a cyber form social networking sites 
provide a space where users feel safe as they 
interact with friends and family in the case of  
home users cyber criminals would continue to 
target social media sites to steal personal data  
not only social networking but also during bank 
transactions a person must take all the required 
security measures

the above  comparison of cyber security 
incidents reported to cyber999  in malaysia  
from january june 2012 and  2013 clearly 
exhibits the cyber security threats  as crime is 
increasing even the  security measures are also  
increasing according to the survey of us technology and healthcare executives 
nationwide silicon valley bank found that 
companies believe cyber attacks are a serious 
threat to both their data and their business 
continuity  
 98 of companies are maintaining or 
increasing their cyber security 
resources and of those half are 
increasing resources devoted to online 
attacks this year  
 the majority of companies are 
preparing for when not if cyber 
attacks occur  
 only one third   are c ompletely 
confident in the security of their 
information and   even less confident 
about the security mea sures of their 
business partners  
 
there will be new attacks on android operating 
system based d evices but it will not be on 
massive scale the fact ta blets share the same 
operating system as smart phones means they 
will be soon targeted by the same malware  as 
those platforms the number of malware 
specimens for macs would continue to grow 
though much less than in the case of pcs 
windows 8  will allow u sers to develop 
applications for virtually any device pcs 
tablets and smart phones running windows 8 
so it will be possible to develop malicious 
applications like those for android  hence these 
are some of the predicted trends in cyber 
security  
 
 
4 trends changing cyber 
security  
 
here mentioned below are some of the trends 
that are having a huge impact on cyber security  
 
41 web servers  
 
the threat of attacks on web applications to 
extract data or to distribute malicious code 
persists cyber crimina ls distribute their 
malicious code via legitimate web servers 
theyve compromised but data stealing attacks 
many of which get the attention of media are 
also a big threat   now we  need a greater 
emphasis on protecting web servers and web 
applications  web servers are especially the best 
platform for these cyber criminals to steal the 
data hence one must always use a safer 
browser especially during important transactions 
in order not to fall as a prey for these crimes  
 
42 cloud computing and its serv ices 
 
these days all small medium and large 
companies are slowly adopting cloud services 
in other words the world is slowly moving 
towards the clouds  this latest trend pres ents a 
big challenge for cyber  security as traffic can 
go around traditional poi nts of inspection 
additionally as the number of applications 
available in the cloud grows policy controls for 
web applications and cloud services will also 
need to evolve  in order to prevent the loss of 
valuable information though cloud services are 
developing their own models still a lot of issues 
are being brought up about their security cloud 
may provide immense opportunities but it 
should always be noted that as the cloud evolves 
so as its security concerns increase  
43 apts and targeted attacks  
 
apt  advanced persistent threat is a  whole 
new level of cyber crime ware  for years 
network security capabilities such as web 
filtering or ips have played a key part in 
identifying such targeted attacks mostly after 
the initial compromise as attackers  grow 
bolder and employ more vague  techniques 
network security must integrate with other 
security services  in order  to detect attacks  
hence one must improve our security techniques 
in order to prevent more threats coming in the 
future  
 
44 mobile networ ks 
 
today we are able to connect to anyone in any 
part of the world but for these mobile networks 
security is a very big concern these days 
firewalls and other security measures are 
becoming porous as people are using devices 
such as tablets phones pc s etc all of which 
again require extra securities apart from those 
present in the applications used we must 
always think about the security issues of these 
mobile networks further mobile networks are 
highly prone to these cyber crimes a lot of care 
must be taken in case of their security issues  
 
45 ipv6 new internet protocol  
 
ipv6 is the new internet protocol which is 
replacing ipv4  the older version which has 
been a backbone of our networks in general and 
the internet at large protecting ipv6 is n ot just a 
question of porting ipv4 capabilities while 
ipv6 is a wholesale replacement in making more 
ip addresses available there are some very 
fundamental changes to the protocol which need  to be considered in security policy  hence it is 
always better  to switch to ipv6 as soon as 
possible in order to reduce the risks regarding 
cyber crime  
 
46 encryption of the code  
 
encryption  is the process of encoding messages 
or information in such a way that 
eavesdro ppers or hackers cannot read it  in an  
encry ption scheme the message or information 
is encrypted using an encryption algorithm 
turning it into an unreadable  cipher text  this is 
usually done with the use of an  encryption key  
which specifies how the message is to be 
encoded  encryption at a very beginning level 
protects data privacy and its integrity but more 
use of encryption brings more c hallenges in 
cyber security  encryption is also used to protect 
data in transit for example data being 
transferred via  networks  eg the  internet  e
commerce  mobile telephones  wireless 
microphones  wireless intercom s etc hence by 
encrypting the code one can know if there is any  
leakage of information  
 
hence the above are some of the trends 
changing the face of cyber security in the world  
the top network threats are  mentioned in below 
fig 1 
 
 
                           fig 1 
 
the above pie chart shows about the major 
threats for networks and cyber security  
 
5 role of social media in 
cyber security  
 
as we become more social in an increasingly 
connecte d world companies must find new 
ways to protect personal information  social 
media plays a huge role in cyber security and 
will contribute a lot to personal cyber threats  
social  media adoption among personnel is 
skyrocketing and so is the threat of attac k since 
social media or social networking sites are 
almost used by most of them every day it has 
become a huge platform for the cyber criminals 
for hacking private information and stealing 
valuable data  
 
in a world where were quick to give up our 
perso nal information companies have to ensure 
theyre just as quick in identifying threats 
responding in real time and avoiding a breach 
of any kind  since people are easily attracted by 
these social media the hackers use them as a bait 
to get the informatio n and the data they require 
hence people must take appropriate measures 
especially in dealing with social media in order 
to prevent the loss of their information  
the ability of individuals to share information 
with an audience of millions is at the heart  of the 
particular challenge that social media presents to 
businesses in addition to giving anyone the 
power to disseminate commercially sensitive 
information social media also gives the same 
power to spread false information which can be 
just being as damaging the  rapid spread of 
false information through social media is among 
the emerging risks identified  in global risks 
2013  report  
though social media can be used for cyber 
crimes these companies  cannot afford to stop 
using social media as it plays an important role 
in publicity of a company   instead they must 
have solutions that will notify them of the threat 
in order to fix it before any real damage is done  
however companies should understand  this and 
recognise the importance of analysing the 
information especially in social conversations 
and provide appropriate security solutions in 
order to stay away from risks o ne must handle 
social media by using certain policies and right 
technologies  
6 cyber  security  techniques  
61 access control and password security  
the concept of user name and password has 
been fundamental way of protecting our 
information this may be one of the first 
measures regarding cyber security  
62 authentication  of data  
the documents that we receive must always be 
authenticated be before downloading that is it should be checked if it has originated from a 
trusted and a reliable source and that they are 
not altered authenticating of these documents 
is usually done by the an ti virus software present 
in the devices thus a good anti virus software is 
also essential to protect the devices from viruses  
63 malware scanners  
this is software that usually scans all the files 
and documents present in the system for 
malicious code o r harmful viruses   viruses  
worms and trojan horses are examples of 
malicious software that are often grouped 
together and referred to as malware  
64 firewalls  
a firewall is  a software program or piece of 
hardware that helps screen out hackers viruses 
and worms that try to reach your computer over 
the internet  all messag es entering or leaving 
the inter net pass through the firewall  present  
which examines each message and blocks those 
that do not meet the specified  security  criteria  
hence firewalls play an important role in 
detecting the malware  
65 anti virus software  
antivirus software is a computer program t hat 
detects prevents and takes action to disarm or 
remove malicious software programs such as 
viruses and worms most antivirus programs 
include an auto update feature that enables the 
program to download profiles of new viruses so 
that it can check for  the new viruses as soon as 
they are discovered   an anti virus software is a 
must and basic necessity for every system  
 
table ii techniques on cyber security  
7 cyber  ethics  
cyber ethics are nothing but the code of the 
internet when we practice these cyber ethics 
there are good chances of us using the internet 
in a proper and safer way the below are a few 
of them  
 do use the internet to communicate 
and interact with other people  email 
and instant messaging make it easy to 
stay in touch with friends and family 
members communicate with work 
colleagues and share ideas and 
information with people across town or 
halfway around the world  
 dont be a bully on the internet  do not 
call people names lie about them send 
embarrassing pictures of them or do 
anything else to try to hurt them   
 internet is considered as worlds largest 
library with information on any topic in 
any subject area so using this 
information in a cor rect and legal way 
is always essential  
 do not operate others accounts using 
their passwords  
 never try to send any kind of malware 
to others systems and make them 
corrupt  
 never share your personal information 
to anyone as there is a good chance of 
others misusing it and finally you 
would end up in a trouble  
 when youre online never pretend to 
the other person and never try to create 
fake accounts on someone else as it 
would land you as well as the other 
person into trouble  
 always adhere to copyrighte d 
information and download games or 
videos only if they are permissible  
the above are a few cyber ethics one must 
follow while using the internet  we are always 
thought proper rules from out very early stages 
the same here we apply in cyber space  
8 conc lusion  
computer security is a vast topic that is 
becoming more important because the world is 
becoming highly interconnected with networks 
being used to carry out critical transactions  
cyber crime continues to diverge down different 
paths with each new y ear that passes  and so 
does the security of the information  the latest 
and disruptive technologies along with the new 
cyber tools and threats that come to light each day are challenging organizations with not only 
how they secure their infra structure b ut how 
they require  new platforms and intelligence to 
do so  there is no perfect solution for cyber 
crimes but we should try our level best to 
minimize them in order to have a safe and 
secure future in cyber space

Abstract —It is a well- known fact that today a nation’s 
telecommunication networks, critical infrastructure, and 
information systems are vulnerable to growing number of attacks 
in cyberspace. Cyber space contains very different problems involving various sets of threats, targets and costs. Cyber security 
is not only problem of banking, communication or transportation. It also threatens core systems of  army as command control.   
Some significant recommendations  on command control (C2) and 
cyber security have been suggested for army computing environment in this paper. This  study addresses priorities of 
“what should be done for a better army cyber future”  to cyber
security researchers.  
Index Terms —Command Control (C2), Army, Future 
Operations, Cyber Security. 
I. INTRODUCTION
NITIALY, wars were conducted via physical instruments 
and signs like whistles or flags.  Especially with the usage of 
telegraph in Crimean War [1] in the 19th century, remote 
command and control (C2) became possible. The rapid development of the instruments like satellites [2] within the space dimension increased the range of C2, while the 
improvement of ground positioning systems [3] increased the 
precision of C2, and lastly co mputers and internet increased 
the obscurity of C2.[4] 
Although the C2 instruments have changed through the 
history [5], its crucial role in warfare has kept its importance; 
it is a necessity to have sheltered, mobile, and modern C2 centers, while it is indispensa ble to train the leaders to 
effectively put to use this capability [6].
The more electronics and mobile devices are improved the 
more the air, land, sea, and sp ace become cyber environments 
[7]. The cyber security became a state issue, where a cyber-
threat for a security system of a state is accepted as a casus belli. Cyber-attack has been defined as “an attack, via 
cyberspace, targeting an enterpris e’s use of cyberspace for the

controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled 
information” by National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) [8]. Besides the cyber defense and cyber-attack capability has also gained importance; however, there is no sufficient legal basis for such an operation [9]. That is why, states focus on identifying the imminent threat and staving it 
off by state-sponsored (non-state) cyber-attacks, instead of directly applying it.  
II.W
HAT SHOULD BEDONE FOR A BETTER CYBER FUTURE ? 
A. Purpose of the Study 
Complexity of modern cyber security is increasing all over 
the world. Today it is a fact that manage cyber threats and cyber incidents without leveraging various collaboration 
instruments with different partners is not possible.  Cyber-
attacks constitute a serious challenge to national security and 
demand greater attention from all public and civil 
establishments. This study men tion main topics about cyber 
security especially for army. The main issues needed to be 
done in terms of future oper ational environments’ command 
control and cyber security are given below. 
B. Main Issues fo r Cyber Security  
Interoperability is a fundamental principle for the operation 
of joint and coalition forces (Fig.1). Army should have the capability to operate in any plac e of the world with the ability 
of “interoperability for joint and coalition operations”. It is 
also crucial that the joint situa tional picture of the operational 
area be presented to joint headquarters. Additionally, cross-
functional structure among the systems should be formed, and centralized C2 systems should be  transformed to decentralized 
C2 systems.  
It is a necessity to introduce programs about cyber security 
in the universities and to encour age the education of qualified 
individuals about it. The purpose of the cyber exercises held 
by armies or scientific centers, should be to create awareness. 
The situational awareness will not be sufficient in future’s 
sophisticated and ambiguous enviro nment. In order to provide 
all of the functional areas in a C2 headquarters work jointly, 
situational awareness should be improved by detecting the Recommendations on Future Operational 
Environment s’Command Control and Cyber 
Security

factors in the environment, appr ehending the current situation, 
and envisaging the future situation (tendency awareness). 
Fig.1. Interoperability [10] 
The armies will increase their Network Enabled Capabilities 
(NEC) in order to eradicate the obscurity of the chaotic future 
warfare environments, and to provide right information, in the 
right time, and in the right place (Fig.2) [10]. However, the 
more the NEC improved, the more the systems/platforms will 
be exposed to cyber- attacks. ‘Embedded Cyber Security 
Technique’ and ‘Operational Area Identification and 
Introduction Systems’ [ 11] should be used to restrain from 
those attacks.  
Fig. 2.  Army network enabled capability [10] 
It is of high importance that an Army, which has mission 
functions that entails different C2 structures, must have the 
capability to conduct via a single and centralized C2 system. In 
addition to this, special weaponry systems for army should be 
compatible for a sophisticated C2. Today the C2 systems in army, depends on software and hardware, which are open to 
cyber- attacks. Thus, ‘National Tactic Data Link’ is necess ary 
for securing the systems.  
Internet search engines ar e the most sophisticated spy 
software of the world, since they store all of the data about the users and draw the data map of the world [12]. They can provide the educational levels of the countries, the contacts of 
the individuals, their social cir cles, and expenses (Fig.3). This 
capability renders those engi nes as the indispensable 
environment for intelligence that is able to analyze so much 
data. In order to preserve from the threats of that capability, it 
is vital to use complicated passwords and to use these systems quantum sufficit. 
 
 
Fig. 3. Search engine usage sample [13] 
Depending on the last developments on Cryptology, 
authentication, access control (for 2 or more people), authorization, strong authentication mechanisms, fast and low-
source-spending crypto algor ithms, asymmetric crypto 
algorithms resistant to quantum computers (rather than symmetric crypto) should be us ed in order to provide data 
security of the NEC systems. It is known that trying to secure 
all kinds of data may decrease the effectiveness of the systems or put systems out of action. Thus, it is essential that, which 
data is worth security, be decided effectively. Instead of commencing the crisis  and operations process with intelligence 
function and following with operation function, the process 
should be defined from the crisis phase cross functionally and 
jointly. 
Network enabled capability gains the upper hand. In order to 
make use of this capability, it is vital to have communications 
networks that enable current sy stems, platforms, and nodal 
points function together. Additio nally, information and nodal 
systems are required to pr ocess the data and prepare it 
compatible with the users’ need s. Moreover, an organization 
structure and a training system (of the users and the decision 
makers) that effectively profits from the network-enabled 
capability are indispensable.

RECOMMENDATIONS ON FUTURE OPERATIONA L ENVIRONMENTS’ COMMAND CONTROL…..
C.Command Control and Tactical Issues  
In the near future, robotic armies and unmanned land 
vehicles will be under command, and most of the 
platforms/systems will depend on satellites. In order to remove weaknesses stemming from satellite signal intervention, a ‘National GPS System’ is vital. By using national GPS system 
Decision Support Systems may provide alternative solutions 
about deployment of artillery weapons and weapon systems, ammunition effect analysis, desired effect, the sort and amount of the ammunition. Metro techniques affect hit rate % 67 
percent in the long-range. In this regard, service-based metro
systems will be widespread. It  is possible to take better 
decisions than the previous  ones, and artificial intelligence 
systems may be helpful for understanding the intention/course 
of action of the enemy using Learning Systems.  
‘Vetronics’ systems  were introduced with the developments 
in the land vehicles (Fig.4) [14],[15]. In the middle of the 
battle, if the commander needs to  change his vehicle due to 
mechanic problems, he will have the capability to use the new vehicle as a command and control vehicle with the help of ‘mountable systems’  [16]. 
With the help of tactic wireless net communication system 
applications, all of the forces, particularly Navy, will have the 
capability to communicate worldwide securely, based on 
completely national means.  
Studies and researches are in pr ogress on the use of ‘Service 
Based Architecture’ by the mobile elements on the field and on
the tactical field communication nets. It is predictable that 
service based architecture will be used on a broader band in between command centers over brigade level in the short and 
medium term. The C2 systems situational awareness will be 
available for the single soldier on the field as well as the high 
level command, parallel to the te chnologic dev elopments, and 
functional capabilities will incr ease with that. Identification 
system is as important as detection system on the unmanned aerial vehicles, in that context, by help of Terahertz 
technology, which follows the terahertz rays that objects radiate, the identification of the weapons, explosive, chemical, 
and biological materials and similar security inspections will 
be available.   
It is possible to use network enabled capability in strategic, 
operative, and tactic levels; however, it will be difficult to use 
it in single soldier / single vehicle level regarding the hardships of the combat. Thus, it is vital to define the levels 
that network enabled capabilities  are planned to operate.  
With the help of a data exchan ge system, different platforms 
should have the ability to activate the weapon systems of each 
other. Most of the systems in army are compatible with 
platform-based operation, rather than network enabled ones, 
which may cause problems in the long run.

III. C ONCLUSION
Recommendations on future operational environments’ 
command control and cyber security has been discussed in this paper. The studies’  goal is to make curi ous researchers some 
main topics about army and cyber security issues.  
It is known that in order to form a new effective defense 
technology base, focused on the needs of army, long term planning, application, and tracking activities should be 
handled with strategic management approach [18],[19]. In this 
context, regarding command, control and information technologies excellence nets C4ISR technologies, which are 
compatible with network centric capability, should be 
prioritized.  Autonomous comma nd and control technologies 
in land, navy and air force vehicles, real time data integration and data fusion, cyber de fense, strategy and tactics 
improvement, protected core, and national nets should also be 
prioritized.   
It is fundamental that national software and hardware be 
used in order to be secure from or least affected from threats. 
Human-education-technology synergy be provided for a 
sufficient cyber defense, and th at a national cyber army and a 
cyber-defense supreme board be formed. It is also important to

promote a cyber-market while improving the research & 
development about cyber security.  
One of the fundamental concept in battlefield environment is 
information flow and security of obtained information. It is 
well known fact by cyber ex perts that physical components 
added to a cyber-system considerably increase the difficulty of determining information flow.  
Todays’ armies have sophisticated command control 
infrastructures includes complex interactions of cyber components. Confidentiality of  operational environment 
requires advanced security integration models. I believe that this work provides an approach for some of the complexities involved in command control and cyber security protection for 
army.

nitialy wars were conducted via physical instruments 
and signs like whistles or flags  especially with the usage of 
telegraph in crimean war 1 in the 19th century remote 
command and control c2 became possible the rapid development of the instruments like satellites 2 within the space dimension increased the range of c2 while the 
improvement of ground positioning systems 3 increased the 
precision of c2 and lastly co mputers and internet increased 
the obscurity of c24 
although the c2 instruments have changed through the 
history 5 its crucial role in warfare has kept its importance 
it is a necessity to have sheltered mobile and modern c2 centers while it is indispensa ble to train the leaders to 
effectively put to use this capability 6
the more electronics and mobile devices are improved the 
more the air land sea and sp ace become cyber environments

1. Introduction
Cyberspace has come to be an integral part of our society. Government agencies, schools, hospitals, corporations,
ﬁnancial institutions and other organizations ceaselessly collect, process, and store a great deal of data on computers
and transmit these conﬁdential data across networks to other computers [1, 2]. However, cyberspace is vulnerable
to a wide range of cyber threats. Sophisticated cyber perpetrators exploit vulnerabilities to steal information and
money and develop capabilities to disrupt and destroy essential cyber services. In light of the risk and potential
consequences of cyber attacks, strengthening the security and resilience of cyberspace has become an important
mission. Cybersecurity is committed to protecting computers, networks, programs and data from unintended or
unauthorized access, change, or destruction [3–5]. You cannot manage if you cannot measure. Before working out
cyberspace security solutions, the security of cyber networks must be evaluated [6–8].

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a newly emerging class of cyber attacks. With a clear goal, an APT
attack is highly targeted, well-organized, well-resourced, covert and long-term [9–11]. APTs pose a severe threat to
cyberspace, because they invalidate conventional cyber defense mechanisms. In the last decade, the number of APTs
increased rapidly and numerous security incidents were reported all over the world [12]. For the purpose of resisting
APTs, it is vital to evaluate the security of cyber networks under APTs. However, due to the persistence of APTs,
existing security evaluation methods are not applicable to APTs [13–17]. Recently, Pendleton et al. [18] considered
the expected fraction of compromised nodes in a cyber network as a security metric of the network. As the fraction is
varying over time, its availability is questionable.
To measure the security of a cyber network under APTs, an APT-based cyber attack-defense process must be
modeled as a continuous-time dynamical system. The individual-level dynamical modeling technique, which has
been applied to areas such as epidemic spreading [19–21], malware spreading [22–29], rumor spreading [30, 31] and
viral marketing [32], is especially suited to the modeling of APT-based cyber attack-defense processes, because the
topological structure of the targeted cyber network can be accommodated [33]. Towards this direction, a number of
APT-based cyber attack-defense models have been proposed [34–36]. In particular, Zheng et al. [37] found that a
special APT-based cyber attack-defense model exhibits a global stability.
This paper focuses on estimating security of cyber networks under APTs. First, an APT-based cyber attack-
defense process is modeled as an individual-level dynamical system. Second, the dynamic model is shown to exhibit
the global stability. On this basis, a new security metric of cyber networks, which is known as the limit security, is
deﬁned as the limit expected fraction of compromised nodes in the networks. Next, the inﬂuence of di erent factors
on the limit security is illuminated through theoretical analysis and computer simulation. This work helps understand
the security of cyber networks under APTs.
The remaining materials are organized this way. Section 2 derives an APT-based cyber attack-defense model.
Section 3 shows the global stability of the model and deﬁnes the limit security of cyber networks. The inﬂuence of
dierent factors on the limit security is made clear in Sections 4 and 5. Finally, Section 6 closes this work.
2. The modeling of APT-based cyber attack-defense processes
For the purpose of evaluating the security of a cyber network under APTs, understanding the relevant cyber attack-
defense process is requisite. This is the goal of this section.
2.1. The cyber network
LetG=(V;E) denote the network interconnecting computers in a given cyber network, where V=f1;;Ng,
each node represents a computer in the cyber network, and there is an edge from node ito node jif and only if
2
computer iis allowed to deliver messages directly to computer jthrough the network. Let A=
ai j
NNdenote the
adjacency matrix for G. Hereafter, Gis assumed to be strongly connected.
In what follows, it is assumed that, at any time, every node in the cyber network is either secure orcompromised ,
where all secure nodes are under the defender’s control, and all compromised nodes are under the attacker’s control.
LetXi(t)=0 and 1 denote that node iis secure and compromised at time t, respectively. Then the state of the cyber
network at time tis represented by the vector
X(t)=(X1(t);X2(t);;XN(t)):
LetSi(t) and Ci(t) denote the probability of node ibeing secure and compromised at time t, respectively.
Si(t)=PrfXi(t)=0g;Ci(t)=PrfXi(t)=1g:
AsSi(t)+Ci(t)1, the vector C(t)=(C1(t);;CN(t))Trepresents the expected state of the cyber network at time t.
2.2. The attack and defense mechanisms
The threat of an APT attack to the cyber network is twofold.
External attack , which is conducted by the external attacker, with the intent of compromising the secure nodes
in the network. The attack strength to secure node iisxi, wherestands for the technical level of external
attack, xistands for the resource per unit time used for attacking node i,PN
i=1xi>0.
Internal infection , which is caused by the compromised nodes in the network, with the intent of compromising
the secure nodes in the network. The infection strength of compromised node ito secure node jisai j, where
stands for the technical level of internal infection. The combined infection strength to secure node iat time t

, where 1 Astands for the indicator function of event A,f(0)=0,f(x)xfor all x0,
fis strictly increasing and concave, and fis second continuously di erentiable.
We refer to the vector x=(x1;;xN) as an attack scheme. The resource per unit time for the attack scheme xis
jjxjj1=PN
i=1xi, wherejjjj 1stands for the 1-norm of vectors. .
The defense of the cyber network against APTs is also twofold.
Prevention, which aims to prevent the secure nodes in the cyber network from being compromised. The pre-
vention strength of secure node iisyi, wherestands for the technical level of prevention, yi>0 stands for
the resource per unit time used for preventing node i.
Recovery, which is intended to recover the compromised nodes in the cyber network. The recovery strength of
compromised iiszi, wherestands for the technical level of recovery, zi>0 stands for the resource per unit
time for recovering node i.

We refer to the vector y=(y1;;yN) as a prevention scheme, the vector z=(z1;;zN) as a recovery scheme,
and the vector ( y;z) as a defense scheme. The resources per unit time for the prevention scheme y, the recovery
scheme yand the defense scheme ( y;z) arejjyjj1,jjzjj1andjjyjj1+jjzjj1, respectively.
Letw=(w1;;wN) denote an attack scheme or a prevention scheme or a recovery scheme. In the subsequent
study, the following two schemes will be used.

2.3. The modeling of APT-based cyber attack-defense processes
For the purpose of modeling APT-based cyber attack-defense processes, the following assumptions are made.
(A1) Due to external attack, at any time secure node igets compromised at ratexi
yi. This assumption is rational,
because the rate is proportional to the attack strength and is inversely proportional to the prevention strength.
(A2) Due to internal infection, at any time secure node igets compromised at ratef
PN
j=1aji1fxj(t)=1g
yi. This assumption
is rational, because the rate is proportional to the combined infection strength and is inversely proportional to
the prevention strength.
(A3) Due to recovery, at any time compromised node ibecomes secure at rate zi. This assumption is rational,
because the rate is proportional to the recovery strength.

advanced persistent threats apts are a newly emerging class of cyber attacks with a clear goal an apt
attack is highly targeted wellorganized wellresourced covert and longterm 911 apts pose a severe threat to
cyberspace because they invalidate conventional cyber defense mechanisms in the last decade the number of apts
increased rapidly and numerous security incidents were reported all over the world 12 for the purpose of resisting
apts it is vital to evaluate the security of cyber networks under apts however due to the persistence of apts
existing security evaluation methods are not applicable to apts 1317 recently pendleton et al 18 considered
the expected fraction of compromised nodes in a cyber network as a security metric of the network as the fraction is
varying over time its availability is questionable
to measure the security of a cyber network under apts an aptbased cyber attackdefense process must be
modeled as a continuoustime dynamical system the individuallevel dynamical modeling technique which has
been applied to areas such as epidemic spreading 1921 malware spreading 2229 rumor spreading 30 31 and
viral marketing 32 is especially suited to the modeling of aptbased cyber attackdefense processes because the
topological structure of the targeted cyber network can be accommodated 33 towards this direction a number of
aptbased cyber attackdefense models have been proposed 3436 in particular zheng et al 37 found that a
special aptbased cyber attackdefense model exhibits a global stability
this paper focuses on estimating security of cyber networks under apts first an aptbased cyber attack
defense process is modeled as an individuallevel dynamical system second the dynamic model is shown to exhibit
the global stability on this basis a new security metric of cyber networks which is known as the limit security is
dened as the limit expected fraction of compromised nodes in the networks next the inuence of di erent factors
on the limit security is illuminated through theoretical analysis and computer simulation this work helps understand
the security of cyber networks under apts
the remaining materials are organized this way section 2 derives an aptbased cyber attackdefense model

dierent factors on the limit security is made clear in sections 4 and 5 finally section 6 closes this work

ABSTRACT  
Computing systems and mobile technologies have changed 
dramatically since the introduction of firewall technology in 1988. 
The internet has grown from a simple network of networks to a 
cyber and physical entity that encompasses the entire planet. Cyber -
physical systems(CPS) now control most of the day to day 
operations of human civilization from autonomous cars to nuclear 
energy plants. While phenomenal, this growth has created new 
security threats. These are threats that cannot be blocked by a 
firewall for they are not only cyber but cyber -physical. In light of 
these cyber -physical threats, this paper proposes a security measure 
that promises to enhance the security of cyber -physical systems. 
Using theoretical cyber, physical, and cyber -physical at tack 
scenarios, this paper highlights the need for additional monitoring 
of cyber -physical systems as an extra security measure. 
Additionally, we illustrate the efficiency of the proposed monitor 
using a Shannon entropy proof, and a multiple security domai n 
nondeducibility  (MSDND) proof.

1 Introduction  
In May of 2017, a ransomware attack held most o f the 
developed world hostage, c rippling healthcare systems, 
manufacturing systems , and multiple critical infrastructures across the globe. The British National Health Services was forced to limit 
health care to only emergency cases  [7]. If not for a timely kill 
switch, the attack could have brought forth catastrophic damage to 
nuclear plants, air transportation systems, and many other 
infrastructures. The Wannacry  [7] ransomware attack is a  recent 
example o f a now critical threat . A great many cyber and physical 
attacks keep cropping up all over the world, most notably; the Iran 
stuxnet attack  [4] , which, according to Iran’s civil defense agency, 
was still a threat in October of 2018  [18], the byzantine replay 
attack  [19], and the  Ukraine power grid attack that left more than 
230,000 people without electricity  [20]. [23] provides an extensive 
list of typical security threats that are facing smart -city CPS and 
detailed countermeasures available to defend against these.  
Because cybe r-physical systems (CPS), are physical entities with 
cyber functionality, traditional cybersecurity measures are simply 
not sufficient to mitigate the threat posed by this new wave of 
cyber -physical attacks  [1]. While traditional cyber attacks were 
easily deducible and susceptible to prevention by means of a 
firewall or antivirus software, it has been shown that recent attacks 
like the Iran Stuxnet attack could go undetected for long periods of 
time [5]. A search for a solution to these threats should, ther efore, 
focus on making the occurrence of such attacks almost impossible, 
and if the attacks remain possible, then they should at least be 
swiftly deducible.  
The protection of cyber -physical systems cannot depend 
on the effectiveness of a single detection m echanism  [5]. However, 
the majority of the proposed Cyber -physical security measures 
have centered around the notion of a single monitoring unit. The 
Shadow Security Unit(SSU)  [16] proposed by Cruz et al is a viable 
idea, but considering that the SSU is a single unit that employs only 
cybersecurity measures, a cyber attack that targets the central 
monitoring unit itself, if not detected early, could be fatal to the rest 
of the CPS. Scaglione, Peisert, and McParland acknowledge the 
need for both a centralize d and distributed monitor but the proposed 
monitor is only an algorithm  [14]. While it’s a great algorithm, it’s 
still a cyber measure which will inevitably be vulnerable to some 
cyber attack. The same could be said about the Intrusion Detection 
Systems(ID Ss) [15], that is, IDSs are also a single cyber measure. 
For an extensive look at the many cyber attacks, industry CPS 
models, and common cyber measure, we direct the reader to [19].  
Other than purely cyber measures, some scholars hav e 
proposed the use of  physics based measures to detect attacks , but ∗Article Title Footnote needs to be captured as Title Note

 these very rarely provide ways to mitigate the attacks or prevent 
them in the first place  [21]. The primary idea o f those methods is 
that physical properties of the system models  can be used to detect 
attacks.  Their paper presents a detailed survey of recent physics -
based attack detection schemes in CPS models. Our research 
proposes the addition of a hybrid monitor spread over virtual nodes 
with randomized features. This addition to a CPS would provide a 
much -needed auxiliary layer of security and also enhance attack 
deductibility.  
This paper is arranged as follows; Section 2 introduces 
the tools used in testing the viability of the proposed hybrid monitor 
as a security measure for CPS. Section 3 gives a comprehensive 
look at the hybrid monitor, listing its features and the reasoning 
behind each feature. Section 4 explain s the methodology used to 
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the hybrid monitor. 
Section 5 presents the test sce narios  and proofs . Section 6  wraps up 
with a short conclusion.  
2 Background  
This research employs the Future Renewable Electric 
Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM)  [2] System as a 
model CPS. Shannon entropy  [8] is used as a tool to test the 
effectiveness of the monitor as a security measure. The multiple 
security domain nondeducibility(MSDND)  [1] is used as a tool to 
test the eff ectiveness of the monitor in detecting attacks.  
 The FREEDM system center is a  engineering research 
center funded by the National Science Foundation and spanning 
number of universities including but not limited to North Carolina 
State University, Missouri University of Science and Technology  
and Florida State University. The research center developed an 
energy management and distribution smart grid system located at 
the North Carolina State University that is also referred to as 
FREEDM  [2]. The heart of this energy system is the Distributed 
Grid Intelligence  (DGI)  [2], an intelligent algorithm that 
implements energy management and distribution using modular 
adapters to interact with devices in a smart grid over different 
interfaces. In this paper , the FREEDM system is employed as a test 
subject for the implementation of the hybrid monitor proposed by 
this research.  
The MSDND model is a security model that tests the 
integrity and confidentiality of a cyber -physical architecture. The 
MSDND model uses logic proofs to test information flow security; 
that is, how information moves among user groups within the 
security dom ains (SDs) that make up the system  [1]. Howser and 
Mcmillin show that maintaining information flow security in CPS 
is challenging because the flow is irrevocably linked among the 
CPS’ cyber and physical units  [1]. Therefore, the MSDND model 
is employed to account for both cyber and physical information 
flow paths. The model defines two system properties namely: 
MSDND secure and notMSDND secure  [1]. An MSDND secure system implies that for information flowing from entity A to entity 
B, entity B cannot deduce whether the information is valid or 
erroneous. This also means while an MSDND secure system is 
desirable if the goal is to maint ain confidentiality, it can  be an 
indicator of the possibility of an attack going undetected. A 
notMSDND secure system implies t he alternative, that is, entity B 
can evaluate the correctness of information obtained from entity A. 
Therefore, in the event of an attack, Howser, and McMillin shows 
that a notMSDND secure system could easily detect the occurrence 
of an attack  [1]. Thudim ila and McMillin demonstrate the 
superiority of MSDND over traditional electronic and 
cryptographic solutions  [3] when applied to detection of attacks in 
Automatic Dependent Surveillance -Broadcast(ADS -B) air traffic 
surveillance system  [3]. For this resear ch, MSDND is used to 
analyze whether a CPS with a hybrid monitor in place would 
deduce the occurrence of an attack.  
Phan  et al introduce the idea of using information flow -
metrics like Shannon entropy to measu re information leakage in 
CPS programs  [9]. Li uses Shannon Entropy to break down the 
physical dynamics of CPS and goes on to show the negative 
entropy that communication adds to the general entropy of a CPS  
[10]. In this text, Shannon Entropy is used to i llustrate the decrease 
in the possibility of an attack in a CPS after the introduction of a 
hybrid monitor. This demonstrates the value of adding a  hybrid  
monitor to CPS architectures as an extra security measure.  
Shannon entropy is an information theory c oncept 
derived from the general idea of information entropy that was 
developed and introduced by Claude Shannon  [8]. Entropy is 
basically a measure of uncertainty in a communication system 
where a low entropy value implies minimal uncertainty and a high 
entropy implies the contrary. Shannon entropy defines entropy ( H) 
as: 
 
Where I is the information content o f the discrete random 
variable X. Therefore we can further define  E[I(X)]  in terms of th e 
probability mass function of X : i.e, 
 
The generally definition of entropy H then comes to:  
 
3 The Hybrid Monitor  

Introduction of a Hybrid Monitor to Cyber -Physical 
Systems  CPS-SPC’19, Nov, 2019, London, UK  
 
 To better protect cyber -physical systems, this research 
proposes the addition of a monitor. Many other researchers have 
explored the use of hybrid monitoring to ensure safety or/and 
security in CPSs. Li et al.  propose extended hybrid automata 
modeling for vehicular CPSs as a safety and control measure  [11]. 
Mao and Chen also introduce a runtime hybrid automaton 
monitoring framework for the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise 
Control Systems(CA CC) [12]. This research borrows the idea of 
hybrid monitoring but with randomization as an additional feature. 
The addition of randomization in information flow paths’ 
generation increases the system’s entropy and in turn, reduces the 
chances of a successf ul attack in a generic CPS. That is because a 
higher number of information flow paths increases the number of 
points the attacker has to corrupt to remain undetected. Below is a 
detailed break down of this hybrid monitor’s features;  
▪ The monitor is hybrid, that is , both virtual and physical, 
central and decentralized. The monitor would have both 
a virtual component and physical component. The virtual 
components would be implemented as a hidden 
algorithm in every Supervisory control and data 
acquisiti on unit (SCADA) in the CPS. The physical 
component of the monitor would be a physical unit 
independent of the entire CPS and running a monitoring 
algorithm whose function is to oversee the operations of 
the monitor’s virtual components. The physical 
compo nent is, therefore, a central unit and the virtual 
components are the decentralized units.  
▪ The monitor should be intelligent enough to generate 
physical invariants for every information flow path in the 
CPS. An invariant is simply a logical assertion that 
should always be true throughout an execution cycle. 
Therefore  physical invariants are logical properties of a 
CPS that cannot be transformed by cyber entities and 
should always be held true. Having physical invariants 
makes the CPS vastly more secure bec ause they are 
secure from being corrupted by cyber attacks. With that 
in mind, the hybrid monitor uses generated physical 
invariants as a validator of the information received from 
other system modules. The automated generation of 
physical invariant using machine learning, deep learning 
or linear regression is also a viable research area. The 
automation of invariant generation is explored further by 
Cruz  et al [16].  
▪ The virtual components of the monitors would 
continuously generate a randomly increasing num ber of 
paths for the flow of information between any two CPS 
entities. The physical monitor should also generate a 
randomly increasing number of virtual paths as a 
compliment to a physical path for the flow of information 
between any two virtual components  of the monitor.  ▪ All paths generated by the monitor should be independent 
of each other. This ensures that all the randomly 
generated paths cannot be collectively corrupted by an 
attacker.  
▪ To reduce the information flow overhead, information 
sent through t he monitors should be sent through a 
randomly chosen path among the generated paths and 
then white noise should be transmitted on the rest of the 
paths.  
▪ The monitor should have a routing algorithm that can be 
employed if the monitor detects a failure or co rruption at 
any of the CPS’ entities.  
▪ Communication between the virtual and physical 
monitor should be done on an entirely different network 
than that used by the rest of the cyber -physical system.  
Note that this hybrid monitor is only a theoretical idea but the exact 
physical realization  should at the very least aim to implement the 
above mentioned features.  
4 Methodology  
This research uses two methods to highlight the 
significance of introducing a hybrid monitor to a CPS .  
4.1 Method 1  
The research employs attack scenarios to examine the 
security of a CPS with and without the hybrid monitor. There are 
three attack scenarios, that is; A purely cyber attack like a 
ransomware on a CPS, a completely phy sical attack like the 
attacker inflicting physical damage to the CPS by, for example, 
cutting wires and a cyber -physical attack like the Iran Stuxnet 
attack expounded upon in Kushner’s  [4] and Karnouskos’  [5] work.  
4.2 Method 2  
In the second method, the research uses two proof models 
i.e Shannon entropy and MSDND to show that the addition of a 
hybrid monitor makes a CPS less susceptible to an undetected 
attack and much more effective at deducing attacks when they do 
occur.  
5 Research Results  
This section details the three attack scenarios, their 
respective results, the Shannon entropy proof, and MSDND proof.  
5.1 Cyber Attack scenario  
As mentioned in the background, the FREEDM system is 
controlled by a distributed algorithm called the DGI. The DGI is 
set up  to run on multiple nodes spread out over a network. It 
CPS-SPC’19, Nov, 2019, London, UK  J. Ceasar  Aguma  et al.  
 
 
 provides an interface for energy management applications to 
communicate with physical power devices.  
 
Figure 1:  The DGI under a WannaCry attack  
Let us assume that a DGI node is being held hostage by 
the wannaCry ransomware  (figure 1). This kind of attack is rather 
easy to detect because ransomware attacks normally make the user 
aware that the attack is in progress. Therefore, for this scenario, 
attack d eductibility is not important. But because the attacker is 
holding a node hostage, all information flowing through this node 
could be infected by the attacker. This could give the attacker 
further access to other nodes since all nodes of the DGI share stat e 
information. At this point, it’s clear that the entire DGI could be 
held hostage. Since the DGI manages the entire FREEDM smart 
grid system, the entire CPS would be either rendered useless or 
could be left vulnerable to more damaging attacks.  
Now let’s c onsider a scenario where a hybrid monitor 
was in place with virtual units running alongside every DGI node 
and a physical unit to oversee the virtual units. Because all traffic 
that goes through a node is verified by the monitor and subjected to 
physical i nvariants generated by the monitor, it would be easy for 
the monitor to flag the presence of the ransomware. Since the 
monitor has information flow routing capabilities, all state 
information from other nodes would be safely rerouted through 
other nodes. W hile the infected node would not be saved, the rest 
of the DGI would continue to function without threat.  
5.2 Physical  Attack scenario  
For this scenario, we assume that an attacker has inflicted 
physical damage to the CPS without using cyber means. The 
damage could be as simple as cutting an Ethernet  cord or breaking 
a sensor. The detection and solution for such an attack are also 
rather simple. However, if the CPS is a critical infrastructure like a 
nuclear reactor that needs to continuously keep some func tions 
fully operational then even this simple attack could prove fatal. 
With a monitor in place, any failure in the CPS would quickly be 
detected. The monitor, through information flow rerouting, would go even further to keep critical functions running whi le the damage 
gets fixed.  
5.3 Cyber -physical  Attack scenario  
The third and last scenario assumes that a microcontroller 
in FREEDM system is infected by Stuxnet  (figure 2) . Erroneous 
Information from this microcontroller could cause catastrophic 
damage to the smart grid. In this case, deducing the presence of the 
Stuxnet and reducing the damage to the smart grid are both 
necessary . 
 Figure 2 : The DGI under a Stuxnet attack  
From the Iran attack, it’s clear that the Stuxnet could go 
unnoticed for a long time if no extra security measure is put in 
place. Although, if the FREEDM system had a hybrid monitor, the 
Stuxnet would be detected because all information from the 
microcontroller would have to be verified by the monitor. Since the 
monitor has physical invariants to prove the correctness of 
information from this microcontroller, any discrepancies in the 
information generated by the Stuxnet would be caught. On 
detection, information flow would then be routed through other 
nodes and fu rther infection would be avoided. The Stuxnet would 
have to infect all random paths used by the hybrid monitor to avoid 
detection. The Shannon Entropy proof below shows that there is a 
very small possibility of the Stuxnet or attacker infecting all of the 
hybrid monitor’s random paths.  
5.4 MSDND proof  
For this proof, let’s look at the cyber -physical Stuxnet 
attack shown above. More specifically, the information path 
between the infected microcontroller and the DGI node process 
running on the computer withou t the monitor.  

Introduction of a Hybrid Monitor to Cyber -Physical 
Systems  CPS-SPC’19, Nov, 2019, London, UK  
 
  
Figure 3 : MSDND evaluation for the DGI without a monitor  
Let us define the two domains as SDnode for the DGI 
node and SDmic for the microcontroller with valuation functions 
Vnode and Vmic respectively. Then consider a scenario where 
arbitrary information (φ) is sent from the infected microcontroller 
to the DGI n ode process. If the DGI node process and 
microcontroller are at the same level of security, then the DGI node 
process will trust that information from the infected microcontroller 
to be valid. Since the information can be either true or false, the 
first co ndition; i.e,.. (SDφmic, SD¬φmic ) for MSDND is met  [1]. 
This is derived from the fact that if φ is true then SDφmic is true or 
if φ is false then SD¬φmic is true hence the xor statement is always 
true. 
The second condition is also satisfied from the 
assum ption that the two domains are at the same security level  [1]. 
Therefore, the DGI node process believes and trusts the infected 
microcontroller. This means the DGI node process has no valuation 
function to prove the validity of φ  [1]. The absence of this v aluation 
function (Vφnode) leaves the system in an MSDND secure system  
[1]. This is the MSDND secure evaluation  shown in figure 4.  
Figure 4 : MSDND evaluation for the DGI with a monitor  
The implication of this MSDND evaluation is that if the 
infected microcontroller sent false information to the DGI node 
process, there would be no way of evaluating that the information is false. Therefore the Stux net would go undetected. Knowin  this, 
let us take a look at a scenario with the monitor in place.  
The difference in this scenario is the presence of a 
monitor that is equipped with physical invariants. Using a physical 
invariant, the monitor can evaluate the validity of φ. With this, the 
monitor c an also determine the state of the microcontroller with 
respect to the validity of φ; i.e,.. There exist a valuation Vφmon 
leaving the state SDφmic deducible  [1]. Hence  the notMSDND 
secure evaluation shown in figure 4.  
The proof shows that in the event of a cyber -physical 
attack like the Stuxnet attack, the presence of a monitor would 
render the attack deducible. For the attack to go undetected with a 
monitor in place, the attacker would have to infect every single 
monitor node, both virtual and physical. T he next Shannon entropy 
proof will show that the possibility of compromising all the monitor 
nodes without being detected is rather minimal.  
5.5 Shannon Entropy proof  
The proof considers two scenarios where the attacker is 
attempting to infect the informat ion flow between the DGI node 
process and the microcontroller.   
First, let us take a look at the entropy of the setup without 
the monitor. There are two possible information flow events x _1 
and x _2 that the attack could target. With a sample space = 2, the  
probability of the attacker successfully infecting information flow 
between the DGI node process and microcontroller is ½. The 
entropy evaluation for this scenario is shown below.  
Figure 5 : Shannon Entropy evaluation for the DGI with out a 
monitor  

CPS-SPC’19, Nov, 2019, London, UK  J. Ceasar  Aguma  et al.  
 
 
 With a monitor in place, the sample space grows to (2n + 
2), making the probability of successfully corrupting one path come 
to 1/[2(n + 1)]. Here is the entropy evaluation;   
Figure 6 : Shannon Entropy evaluation for the DGI with  a 
monitor  
The p roof shows us that the entropy increases with the 
increase in the size of n paths. From the attacker’s point of view, 
the uncertainty increases with increasing size of n paths. Therefore 
as the size of n increases, it becomes much harder for the attacker 
to launch a successful attack on the CPS. By adding the hybrid 
monitor, the system is not fully secure from an attack but the 
possibility of a successful attack is vastly smaller.  
6 Conclusion  
After 2017’s Ransomware attack  [17], the world can not 
ignore the threat posed by the possibility of using attacks on cyber -
physical systems as a tool for terrorism and cyber warfare. The 
increased occurrence of cyber -physical systems attacks is surely an 
indicator that traditional cybersecurity measures are i nsufficient at 
prevention and detection of these attacks. The world needs to start 
considering alternative or improved security measures. The 
combination of an intelligent, randomized physical monitor with 
existing virtual cyber measures to create a hybrid  monitor is a good 
place to start. While, the hybrid monitor is not a foolproof solution 
to cyber -physical attacks, it could well be the best solution yet. 
Future research in this area should focus on physical 
implementation of the hybrid monitor and preve ntion of attacks 
targeting the hybrid monitor itself. This hybrid monitor could be 
the great leap towards fully securing an important and 
nonexpendable entity of smart living that is cyber -physical systems.

1 introduction  
in may of 2017 a ransomware attack held most o f the 
developed world hostage c rippling healthcare systems 
manufacturing systems  and multiple critical infrastructures across the globe the british national health services was forced to limit 
health care to only emergency cases  7 if not for a timely kill 
switch the attack could have brought forth catastrophic damage to 
nuclear plants air transportation systems and many other 
infrastructures the wannacry  7 ransomware attack is a  recent 
example o f a now critical threat  a great many cyber and physical 
attacks keep cropping up all over the world most notably the iran 
stuxnet attack  4  which according to irans civil defense agency 
was still a threat in october of 2018  18 the byzantine replay 
attack  19 and the  ukraine power grid attack that left more than 
230000 people without electricity  20 23 provides an extensive 
list of typical security threats that are facing smart city cps and 
detailed countermeasures available to defend against these  
because cybe rphysical systems cps are physical entities with 
cyber functionality traditional cybersecurity measures are simply 
not sufficient to mitigate the threat posed by this new wave of 
cyber physical attacks  1 while traditional cyber attacks were 
easily deducible and susceptible to prevention by means of a 
firewall or antivirus software it has been shown that recent attacks 
like the iran stuxnet attack could go undetected for long periods of 
time 5 a search for a solution to these threats should ther efore 
focus on making the occurrence of such attacks almost impossible 
and if the attacks remain possible then they should at least be 
swiftly deducible  
the protection of cyber physical systems cannot depend 
on the effectiveness of a single detection m echanism  5 however 
the majority of the proposed cyber physical security measures 
have centered around the notion of a single monitoring unit the 
shadow security unitssu  16 proposed by cruz et al is a viable 
idea but considering that the ssu is a single unit that employs only 
cybersecurity measures a cyber attack that targets the central 
monitoring unit itself if not detected early could be fatal to the rest 
of the cps scaglione peisert and mcparland acknowledge the 
need for both a centralize d and distributed monitor but the proposed 
monitor is only an algorithm  14 while its a great algorithm its 
still a cyber measure which will inevitably be vulnerable to some 
cyber attack the same could be said about the intrusion detection 
systemsid ss 15 that is idss are also a single cyber measure 
for an extensive look at the many cyber attacks industry cps 
models and common cyber measure we direct the reader to 19

 these very rarely provide ways to mitigate the attacks or prevent 
them in the first place  21 the primary idea o f those methods is 
that physical properties of the system models  can be used to detect 
attacks  their paper presents a detailed survey of recent physics 
based attack detection schemes in cps models our research 
proposes the addition of a hybrid monitor spread over virtual nodes 
with randomized features this addition to a cps would provide a 
much needed auxiliary layer of security and also enhance attack 
deductibility  
this paper is arranged as follows section 2 introduces 
the tools used in testing the viability of the proposed hybrid monitor 
as a security measure for cps section 3 gives a comprehensive 
look at the hybrid monitor listing its features and the reasoning 
behind each feature section 4 explain s the methodology used to 
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the hybrid monitor 
section 5 presents the test sce narios  and proofs  section 6  wraps up 
with a short conclusion  
2 background  
this research employs the future renewable electric 
energy delivery and management freedm  2 system as a 
model cps shannon entropy  8 is used as a tool to test the 
effectiveness of the monitor as a security measure the multiple 
security domain nondeducibilitymsdnd  1 is used as a tool to 
test the eff ectiveness of the monitor in detecting attacks  
 the freedm system center is a  engineering research 
center funded by the national science foundation and spanning 
number of universities including but not limited to north carolina 
state university missouri university of science and technology  
and florida state university the research center developed an 
energy management and distribution smart grid system located at 
the north carolina state university that is also referred to as 
freedm  2 the heart of this energy system is the distributed 
grid intelligence  dgi  2 an intelligent algorithm that 
implements energy management and distribution using modular 
adapters to interact with devices in a smart grid over different 
interfaces in this paper  the freedm system is employed as a test 
subject for the implementation of the hybrid monitor proposed by 
this research  
the msdnd model is a security model that tests the 
integrity and confidentiality of a cyber physical architecture the 
msdnd model uses logic proofs to test information flow security 
that is how information moves among user groups within the 
security dom ains sds that make up the system  1 howser and 
mcmillin show that maintaining information flow security in cps 
is challenging because the flow is irrevocably linked among the 
cps cyber and physical units  1 therefore the msdnd model 
is employed to account for both cyber and physical information 
flow paths the model defines two system properties namely 
msdnd secure and notmsdnd secure  1 an msdnd secure system implies that for information flowing from entity a to entity 
b entity b cannot deduce whether the information is valid or 
erroneous this also means while an msdnd secure system is 
desirable if the goal is to maint ain confidentiality it can  be an 
indicator of the possibility of an attack going undetected a 
notmsdnd secure system implies t he alternative that is entity b 
can evaluate the correctness of information obtained from entity a 
therefore in the event of an attack howser and mcmillin shows 
that a notmsdnd secure system could easily detect the occurrence 
of an attack  1 thudim ila and mcmillin demonstrate the 
superiority of msdnd over traditional electronic and 
cryptographic solutions  3 when applied to detection of attacks in 
automatic dependent surveillance broadcastads b air traffic 
surveillance system  3 for this resear ch msdnd is used to 
analyze whether a cps with a hybrid monitor in place would 
deduce the occurrence of an attack  
phan  et al introduce the idea of using information flow 
metrics like shannon entropy to measu re information leakage in 
cps programs  9 li uses shannon entropy to break down the 
physical dynamics of cps and goes on to show the negative 
entropy that communication adds to the general entropy of a cps  
10 in this text shannon entropy is used to i llustrate the decrease 
in the possibility of an attack in a cps after the introduction of a 
hybrid monitor this demonstrates the value of adding a  hybrid  
monitor to cps architectures as an extra security measure  
shannon entropy is an information theory c oncept 
derived from the general idea of information entropy that was 
developed and introduced by claude shannon  8 entropy is 
basically a measure of uncertainty in a communication system 
where a low entropy value implies minimal uncertainty and a high 
entropy implies the contrary shannon entropy defines entropy  h 
as 
 
where i is the information content o f the discrete random 
variable x therefore we can further define  eix  in terms of th e 
probability mass function of x  ie 
 
the generally definition of entropy h then comes to

introduction of a hybrid monitor to cyber physical 
systems  cpsspc19 nov 2019 london uk  
 
 to better protect cyber physical systems this research 
proposes the addition of a monitor many other researchers have 
explored the use of hybrid monitoring to ensure safety orand 
security in cpss li et al  propose extended hybrid automata 
modeling for vehicular cpss as a safety and control measure  11 
mao and chen also introduce a runtime hybrid automaton 
monitoring framework for the cooperative adaptive cruise 
control systemsca cc 12 this research borrows the idea of 
hybrid monitoring but with randomization as an additional feature 
the addition of randomization in information flow paths 
generation increases the systems entropy and in turn reduces the 
chances of a successf ul attack in a generic cps that is because a 
higher number of information flow paths increases the number of 
points the attacker has to corrupt to remain undetected below is a 
detailed break down of this hybrid monitors features  
 the monitor is hybrid that is  both virtual and physical 
central and decentralized the monitor would have both 
a virtual component and physical component the virtual 
components would be implemented as a hidden 
algorithm in every supervisory control and data 
acquisiti on unit scada in the cps the physical 
component of the monitor would be a physical unit 
independent of the entire cps and running a monitoring 
algorithm whose function is to oversee the operations of 
the monitors virtual components the physical 
compo nent is therefore a central unit and the virtual 
components are the decentralized units  
 the monitor should be intelligent enough to generate 
physical invariants for every information flow path in the 
cps an invariant is simply a logical assertion that 
should always be true throughout an execution cycle 
therefore  physical invariants are logical properties of a 
cps that cannot be transformed by cyber entities and 
should always be held true having physical invariants 
makes the cps vastly more secure bec ause they are 
secure from being corrupted by cyber attacks with that 
in mind the hybrid monitor uses generated physical 
invariants as a validator of the information received from 
other system modules the automated generation of 
physical invariant using machine learning deep learning 
or linear regression is also a viable research area the 
automation of invariant generation is explored further by 
cruz  et al 16  
 the virtual components of the monitors would 
continuously generate a randomly increasing num ber of 
paths for the flow of information between any two cps 
entities the physical monitor should also generate a 
randomly increasing number of virtual paths as a 
compliment to a physical path for the flow of information 
between any two virtual components  of the monitor   all paths generated by the monitor should be independent 
of each other this ensures that all the randomly 
generated paths cannot be collectively corrupted by an 
attacker  
 to reduce the information flow overhead information 
sent through t he monitors should be sent through a 
randomly chosen path among the generated paths and 
then white noise should be transmitted on the rest of the 
paths  
 the monitor should have a routing algorithm that can be 
employed if the monitor detects a failure or co rruption at 
any of the cps entities  
 communication between the virtual and physical 
monitor should be done on an entirely different network 
than that used by the rest of the cyber physical system  
note that this hybrid monitor is only a theoretical idea but the exact 
physical realization  should at the very least aim to implement the 
above mentioned features  
4 methodology  
this research uses two methods to highlight the 
significance of introducing a hybrid monitor to a cps   
41 method 1  
the research employs attack scenarios to examine the 
security of a cps with and without the hybrid monitor there are 
three attack scenarios that is a purely cyber attack like a 
ransomware on a cps a completely phy sical attack like the 
attacker inflicting physical damage to the cps by for example 
cutting wires and a cyber physical attack like the iran stuxnet 
attack expounded upon in kushners  4 and karnouskos  5 work  
42 method 2  
in the second method the research uses two proof models 
ie shannon entropy and msdnd to show that the addition of a 
hybrid monitor makes a cps less susceptible to an undetected 
attack and much more effective at deducing attacks when they do 
occur  
5 research results  
this section details the three attack scenarios their 
respective results the shannon entropy proof and msdnd proof  
51 cyber attack scenario  
as mentioned in the background the freedm system is 
controlled by a distributed algorithm called the dgi the dgi is 
set up  to run on multiple nodes spread out over a network it 
cpsspc19 nov 2019 london uk  j ceasar  aguma  et al  
 
 
 provides an interface for energy management applications to 
communicate with physical power devices  
 
figure 1  the dgi under a wannacry attack  
let us assume that a dgi node is being held hostage by 
the wannacry ransomware  figure 1 this kind of attack is rather 
easy to detect because ransomware attacks normally make the user 
aware that the attack is in progress therefore for this scenario 
attack d eductibility is not important but because the attacker is 
holding a node hostage all information flowing through this node 
could be infected by the attacker this could give the attacker 
further access to other nodes since all nodes of the dgi share stat e 
information at this point its clear that the entire dgi could be 
held hostage since the dgi manages the entire freedm smart 
grid system the entire cps would be either rendered useless or 
could be left vulnerable to more damaging attacks  
now lets c onsider a scenario where a hybrid monitor 
was in place with virtual units running alongside every dgi node 
and a physical unit to oversee the virtual units because all traffic 
that goes through a node is verified by the monitor and subjected to 
physical i nvariants generated by the monitor it would be easy for 
the monitor to flag the presence of the ransomware since the 
monitor has information flow routing capabilities all state 
information from other nodes would be safely rerouted through 
other nodes w hile the infected node would not be saved the rest 
of the dgi would continue to function without threat  
52 physical  attack scenario  
for this scenario we assume that an attacker has inflicted 
physical damage to the cps without using cyber means the 
damage could be as simple as cutting an ethernet  cord or breaking 
a sensor the detection and solution for such an attack are also 
rather simple however if the cps is a critical infrastructure like a 
nuclear reactor that needs to continuously keep some func tions 
fully operational then even this simple attack could prove fatal 
with a monitor in place any failure in the cps would quickly be 
detected the monitor through information flow rerouting would go even further to keep critical functions running whi le the damage 
gets fixed  
53 cyber physical  attack scenario  
the third and last scenario assumes that a microcontroller 
in freedm system is infected by stuxnet  figure 2  erroneous 
information from this microcontroller could cause catastrophic 
damage to the smart grid in this case deducing the presence of the 
stuxnet and reducing the damage to the smart grid are both 
necessary  
 figure 2  the dgi under a stuxnet attack  
from the iran attack its clear that the stuxnet could go 
unnoticed for a long time if no extra security measure is put in 
place although if the freedm system had a hybrid monitor the 
stuxnet would be detected because all information from the 
microcontroller would have to be verified by the monitor since the 
monitor has physical invariants to prove the correctness of 
information from this microcontroller any discrepancies in the 
information generated by the stuxnet would be caught on 
detection information flow would then be routed through other 
nodes and fu rther infection would be avoided the stuxnet would 
have to infect all random paths used by the hybrid monitor to avoid 
detection the shannon entropy proof below shows that there is a

for this proof lets look at the cyber physical stuxnet 
attack shown above more specifically the information path 
between the infected microcontroller and the dgi node process 
running on the computer withou t the monitor

figure 3  msdnd evaluation for the dgi without a monitor  
let us define the two domains as sdnode for the dgi 
node and sdmic for the microcontroller with valuation functions 
vnode and vmic respectively then consider a scenario where 
arbitrary information  is sent from the infected microcontroller 
to the dgi n ode process if the dgi node process and 
microcontroller are at the same level of security then the dgi node 
process will trust that information from the infected microcontroller 
to be valid since the information can be either true or false the 
first co ndition ie sdmic sdmic  for msdnd is met  1 
this is derived from the fact that if  is true then sdmic is true or 
if  is false then sdmic is true hence the xor statement is always 
true 
the second condition is also satisfied from the 
assum ption that the two domains are at the same security level  1 
therefore the dgi node process believes and trusts the infected 
microcontroller this means the dgi node process has no valuation 
function to prove the validity of   1 the absence of this v aluation 
function vnode leaves the system in an msdnd secure system  
1 this is the msdnd secure evaluation  shown in figure 4  
figure 4  msdnd evaluation for the dgi with a monitor  
the implication of this msdnd evaluation is that if the 
infected microcontroller sent false information to the dgi node 
process there would be no way of evaluating that the information is false therefore the stux net would go undetected knowin  this 
let us take a look at a scenario with the monitor in place  
the difference in this scenario is the presence of a 
monitor that is equipped with physical invariants using a physical 
invariant the monitor can evaluate the validity of  with this the 
monitor c an also determine the state of the microcontroller with 
respect to the validity of  ie there exist a valuation vmon 
leaving the state sdmic deducible  1 hence  the notmsdnd 
secure evaluation shown in figure 4  
the proof shows that in the event of a cyber physical 
attack like the stuxnet attack the presence of a monitor would 
render the attack deducible for the attack to go undetected with a 
monitor in place the attacker would have to infect every single 
monitor node both virtual and physical t he next shannon entropy 
proof will show that the possibility of compromising all the monitor 
nodes without being detected is rather minimal  
55 shannon entropy proof  
the proof considers two scenarios where the attacker is 
attempting to infect the informat ion flow between the dgi node 
process and the microcontroller   
first let us take a look at the entropy of the setup without 
the monitor there are two possible information flow events x 1 
and x 2 that the attack could target with a sample space  2 the  
probability of the attacker successfully infecting information flow 
between the dgi node process and microcontroller is  the 
entropy evaluation for this scenario is shown below  
figure 5  shannon entropy evaluation for the dgi with out a

cpsspc19 nov 2019 london uk  j ceasar  aguma  et al  
 
 
 with a monitor in place the sample space grows to 2n  
2 making the probability of successfully corrupting one path come 
to 12n  1 here is the entropy evaluation   
figure 6  shannon entropy evaluation for the dgi with  a 
monitor  
the p roof shows us that the entropy increases with the 
increase in the size of n paths from the attackers point of view 
the uncertainty increases with increasing size of n paths therefore 
as the size of n increases it becomes much harder for the attacker 
to launch a successful attack on the cps by adding the hybrid 
monitor the system is not fully secure from an attack but the 
possibility of a successful attack is vastly smaller  
6 conclusion  
after 2017s ransomware attack  17 the world can not 
ignore the threat posed by the possibility of using attacks on cyber 
physical systems as a tool for terrorism and cyber warfare the 
increased occurrence of cyber physical systems attacks is surely an 
indicator that traditional cybersecurity measures are i nsufficient at 
prevention and detection of these attacks the world needs to start 
considering alternative or improved security measures the 
combination of an intelligent randomized physical monitor with 
existing virtual cyber measures to create a hybrid  monitor is a good 
place to start while the hybrid monitor is not a foolproof solution 
to cyber physical attacks it could well be the best solution yet 
future research in this area should focus on physical 
implementation of the hybrid monitor and preve ntion of attacks 
targeting the hybrid monitor itself this hybrid monitor could be 
the great leap towards fully securing an important and 
nonexpendable entity of smart living that is cyber physical systems

CPES-QSM: A Quantitative Method Towards the
Secure Operation of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems
Juan Ospina, Member, IEEE, Venkatesh Venkataramanan, Member, IEEE ,
Charalambos Konstantinou, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract —Power systems are evolving into cyber-physical en-
ergy systems (CPES) mainly due to the integration of modern
communication and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. CPES se-
curity evaluation is challenging since the physical and cyber
layers are often not considered holistically. Existing literature
focuses on only optimizing the operation of either the physical
or cyber layer while ignoring the interactions between them.
This paper proposes a metric, the Cyber-Physical Energy System
Quantitative Security Metric (CPES-QSM), that quantiﬁes the
interaction between the cyber and physical layers across three
domains: electrical, cyber-risk, and network topology. A method
for incorporating the proposed cyber-metric into operational
decisions is also proposed by formulating a cyber-constrained
AC optimal power ﬂow (C-ACOPF) that considers the status of
all the CPES layers. The C-ACOPF considers the vulnerabilities
of physical and cyber networks by incorporating factors such
as voltage stability, contingencies, graph-theory, and IoT cyber
risks, while using a multi-criteria decision-making technique.
Simulation studies are conducted using standard IEEE test
systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed metric and
the C-ACOPF formulation.

I. I NTRODUCTION
THE modernization and decentralization of electric power
systems (EPS) are being facilitated by the integration
of distributed energy resources (DERs) and the wide-scale
deployment of internet-of-things (IoT) devices and information
and communication technologies (ICTs). However, this mod-
ernization and transformation from old passive EPS to cyber-
physical energy systems (CPES) have their disadvantages.
Progressively, CPES are becoming more challenging to secure
due to the incorporation of IoT/ICT devices that introduce
cyber vulnerabilities to physical systems, thus creating attack
vectors not previously considered in traditional power system
operations [1].Recent attack incidents such as BlackEnergy, CrashOver-
ride, and Triton illustrate the growing threat of vulnerabilities
in the IoT/ICT infrastructure of power systems [2], [3]. One
prominent example of an attack incident affecting the power
grid is the 2015 Ukraine cyber-attack [4]. In this case, ad-
versaries were able to trip important circuit breakers causing
a blackout that affected almost 225,000 customers. Other
examples of potential threats to EPS are explored in [5], [6],
where authors demonstrated how attackers can compromise
phasor measurement units (PMUs) by spooﬁng GPS signals
via the use of open-source exploitation methods and open-
source intelligence (OSINT) techniques.
Even though the electricity sector has matured in the deploy-
ment of protection systems, researchers and stakeholders still
struggle when quantifying the cybersecurity status and vulner-
abilities of systems operating in a CPES [7]. Conventionally,
metrics exist to quantify either the cyber or the physical
domain independently. For instance in the cyber domain, Infor-
mation Technology (IT) systems metrics such as the Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) [8] exist, which only
relies on IT experts’ opinions to grade vulnerabilities based
on several factors, such as attack vector and attack complexity.
While CVSS is useful for analyzing vulnerabilities for IT sys-
tems, the framework is insufﬁcient when considering critical
infrastructure systems. Trying to address these issues, efforts
such as the CERT Resilience Management Model [9], the
MITRE’s Cyber Resilience Engineering Framework (CREF)
[10], and the Infrastructure Resilience Analysis Methodology
(IRAM) [4], have been proposed but fail to provide sufﬁciently
useful information to system operators due to not having direct
interpretations related to the operation of CPES.
While there are metrics that compute individual physical and
cyber resiliency factors, there is a lack of metrics designed
to study cyber-physical security rigorously in an integrated
manner. Also, many of the metrics proposed in the literature
are an aggregation of existing metrics, that need domain
specialists to interpret them. That is why authors have focused
on addressing this lack of existing metrics by proposing
different resiliency metrics and methods specially tailored for
small-scale CPES. An example is presented in [11], where
authors propose resiliency metrics that capture the level of
preparedness of a distribution system to resist extreme adverse
conditions. In [12], authors propose a stochastic security-
oriented risk management technique devised to estimate cyber-
physical security indices tailored to measure the security level
of a cyber-physical system (CPS).
The papers presented in [13] and [14] are the ones that are
closer to the idea proposed in this paper, since the metrics and
methods proposed in these papers follow a similar formulation
based on a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach.
In these papers, the authors explore the concept of combining
different factors, coming from different domains such as
the physical, cyber, and device-management domains, using
Choquet Integrals (CI) to compute an overall resiliency score
of the system. The main differences between our proposed
approach and the methods presented in these papers are related
to the: (a)factors considered (different physical, graph-theory,
and cyber factors), (b)individual scoring metric for each

node/bus in the CPES (thus improving visibility and human-
in-the-loop (HiTL) processes), and (c)the utilization of the
proposed cyber-metric as a deciding factor to improve not only
the resilience but the overall cyber-physical security state of
AC optimal power ﬂow (ACOPF) solutions for CPES.
Another major contribution of this paper is related to the
utilization of the proposed cyber-metric as a factor that directly
alters the traditional ACOPF solutions of a CPES based on the
real-time cybersecurity status of the system, and thus, in a way
merging the physical and the cyber domains. A limited number
of papers have explored the idea of modifying the ACOPF
formulation so that it can integrate the status of the cyber layer
of the CPES. One example is the paper presented in [15],
where authors propose a cyber-constrained OPF model for
the emergency response of smart grids. The proposed model
considers both the physical and cyber network by adding
cyber-related constraints to the traditional ACOPF but has the
disadvantage of being a ‘black-and-white’ mapping process
that assumes the total loss of control of a physical bus mapped
to a ‘cyber-blind’ cyber node (cyber-blind meaning a cyber
node that becomes invisible due to failing). Another similar
paper is the one presented in [16], where authors develop a
multi-agent-based algorithm designed to optimize the power
ﬂow of a CPES based on power ﬂow constraints derived
from ‘community resilience’ factors such as levels of emotion,
empathy, cooperation, and physical health of consumers. The
community and cyber-layer factors are measured based on
social media sentiment analysis and other social and human
factors related to cognitive science and psychology.
A. Contributions
Contrasting from the papers examined, this paper aims
to address the speciﬁc problem of quantitatively measuring
the real-time cyber-physical security of a CPES considering
factors that affect both its physical and cyber domains by
proposing a novel cyber-metric. It intends to provide an
intuitive and easy-to-understand metric that can be used for
HiTL operations and can directly reﬂect the cyber-physical
status of the CPES into the ACOPF solutions so that the
optimization can be performed not only based on the physicalstatus of the system but considering its current cyber status.
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
A quantitative cyber-physical security metric for CPES is
proposed. The Cyber-Physical Energy System Quantita-
tive Security Metric (CPES-QSM) is designed to quantify
the current cyber-physical status of every IoT-connected
node in a CPES by combining factors from the electrical,
IT, and graph-theory domains using an MCDM approach.
The metric provides an easy-to-interpret way to evaluate
the current state of the CPES.
A cyber-constrained ACOPF formulation that takes into
account not only the physical state of the system but
also considers the current status of its cyber domain,
using the proposed CPES-QSM as a proxy, is proposed.
The formulation is intended to restrict the OPF solution
space based on the current cyber status of nodes in
the system, which can make them ‘unreliable’ based on
vulnerabilities or modeled attack-graphs threats targeting
IoT devices deployed in the respective nodes of the CPES.
Experimental case studies are investigated using standard
IEEE test systems to demonstrate the usefulness of the
proposed cyber-metric and validate the utilization of
the cyber-constrained ACOPF formulation for achieving
more secure OPF solutions (i.e., considering both the
physical and cyber status). The results show how the pro-
posed formulation improves the security and stability of
the system when a cyberattack compromises vulnerable
nodes.
Fig. 1 depicts the overall framework for the use of the pro-
posed CPES-QSM in conjunction with the cyber-constrained
ACOPF formulation with the objective of reaching a more
secure operating state by adjusting the system’s dispatch. The
ﬁgure illustrates how different factors coming from the cyber,
physical, and graph environments are combined into a single
quantitative score that is used to improve system’s operation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II presents the proposed quantitative cyber-physical security
metric, CPES-QSM. Section III focuses on presenting the
proposed cyber-constrained ACOPF formulation that makes
use of the CPES-QSM as a proxy for constraining the optimal
solutions based on the cyber factors of the CPES. Section IV

presents the experimental setup and case studies performed to
evaluate the utility of the proposed cyber-metric and demon-
strate its effectiveness for constraining the traditional ACOPF.
Finally, Section V presents conclusions and future work.
II. CPES-QSM C OMPUTATION & F ACTORS
This section presents the proposed quantitative cyber-
physical metric, CPES-QSM, that is designed to provide a
real-time numerical value to the cyber and physical status of an
operating CPES. The CPES-QSM cyber-metric provides, via
an easy-to-interpret score, operating observability of individual
components and/or nodes in a CPES that can be used and
interpreted by both human operators and control systems for
improving the secure and resilient operation of CPES.
Before the computation of the CPES-QSM is presented,
we need to examine the different factors that affect the ﬁnal
computation of the score. Since our focus is towards CPES,
the factors considered cover the following three main domains:
(1)Electrical , (2) IT, and (3) Graph theory-based . Within
these domains, factors are also classiﬁed according to the
environment they affect. The environments being considered
are: (1) Physical , (2) Cyber , and (3) Network . Each factor,
explained in the next subsections, has been categorized using
one domain and one environment. Additional details about
each factor are presented in Table I using a similar format as
the one presented by EPRI in [17], [18]. It is important to note
that the cyber-metric framework presented in this paper is not
tied to the speciﬁc factors presented throughout the manuscript
and the user/operator has the liberty to choose the factors that
he/she thinks better characterizes the physical/cyber/network
system being analyzed.
A. Electrical Domain Factors
TheElectrical Domain factors encompass all factors directly
related to the electrical or physical operation of the CPES.
1) Contingency Ranking Performance Index (CRPI): This
factor calculates a contingency performance index, using the
fast decoupled power ﬂow (FDPF) 1P1Q contingency ranking
method [19], that provides information about the most suscep-
tible lines and buses in a CPES. The speciﬁc details for the
CRPI factor are shown in Table I. The goal of this factor is
to calculate the performance index (PI) that tells which lines
are most susceptible to overload. Note that Target represents
the objective value of the factor, i.e., the best value is 0while
the worst is 1(CRPI values are scaled to the [0-1] range).
The process for computing the CRPI is based on the process
presented in [19]. A PI value is assigned to each line outage
scenario that can occur in a system. The deﬁnition of the PI
for a contingency outage iis:

focuses on only optimizing the operation of either the physical
or cyber layer while ignoring the interactions between them
this paper proposes a metric the cyberphysical energy system
quantitative security metric cpesqsm that quanties the
interaction between the cyber and physical layers across three
domains electrical cyberrisk and network topology a method
for incorporating the proposed cybermetric into operational
decisions is also proposed by formulating a cyberconstrained

all the cpes layers the cacopf considers the vulnerabilities
of physical and cyber networks by incorporating factors such
as voltage stability contingencies graphtheory and iot cyber
risks while using a multicriteria decisionmaking technique
simulation studies are conducted using standard ieee test

the modernization and decentralization of electric power
systems eps are being facilitated by the integration
of distributed energy resources ders and the widescale
deployment of internetofthings iot devices and information
and communication technologies icts however this mod
ernization and transformation from old passive eps to cyber
physical energy systems cpes have their disadvantages
progressively cpes are becoming more challenging to secure
due to the incorporation of iotict devices that introduce
cyber vulnerabilities to physical systems thus creating attack
vectors not previously considered in traditional power system
operations 1recent attack incidents such as blackenergy crashover
ride and triton illustrate the growing threat of vulnerabilities
in the iotict infrastructure of power systems 2 3 one
prominent example of an attack incident affecting the power
grid is the 2015 ukraine cyberattack 4 in this case ad
versaries were able to trip important circuit breakers causing
a blackout that affected almost 225000 customers other
examples of potential threats to eps are explored in 5 6
where authors demonstrated how attackers can compromise
phasor measurement units pmus by spoong gps signals
via the use of opensource exploitation methods and open
source intelligence osint techniques
even though the electricity sector has matured in the deploy
ment of protection systems researchers and stakeholders still
struggle when quantifying the cybersecurity status and vulner
abilities of systems operating in a cpes 7 conventionally
metrics exist to quantify either the cyber or the physical
domain independently for instance in the cyber domain infor
mation technology it systems metrics such as the common
vulnerability scoring system cvss 8 exist which only
relies on it experts opinions to grade vulnerabilities based
on several factors such as attack vector and attack complexity
while cvss is useful for analyzing vulnerabilities for it sys
tems the framework is insufcient when considering critical
infrastructure systems trying to address these issues efforts
such as the cert resilience management model 9 the
mitres cyber resilience engineering framework cref
10 and the infrastructure resilience analysis methodology
iram 4 have been proposed but fail to provide sufciently
useful information to system operators due to not having direct
interpretations related to the operation of cpes
while there are metrics that compute individual physical and
cyber resiliency factors there is a lack of metrics designed
to study cyberphysical security rigorously in an integrated
manner also many of the metrics proposed in the literature
are an aggregation of existing metrics that need domain
specialists to interpret them that is why authors have focused
on addressing this lack of existing metrics by proposing
different resiliency metrics and methods specially tailored for
smallscale cpes an example is presented in 11 where
authors propose resiliency metrics that capture the level of
preparedness of a distribution system to resist extreme adverse
conditions in 12 authors propose a stochastic security
oriented risk management technique devised to estimate cyber
physical security indices tailored to measure the security level
of a cyberphysical system cps
the papers presented in 13 and 14 are the ones that are
closer to the idea proposed in this paper since the metrics and
methods proposed in these papers follow a similar formulation
based on a multicriteria decision making mcdm approach
in these papers the authors explore the concept of combining
different factors coming from different domains such as
the physical cyber and devicemanagement domains using
choquet integrals ci to compute an overall resiliency score
of the system the main differences between our proposed
approach and the methods presented in these papers are related
to the afactors considered different physical graphtheory

another major contribution of this paper is related to the
utilization of the proposed cybermetric as a factor that directly
alters the traditional acopf solutions of a cpes based on the
realtime cybersecurity status of the system and thus in a way
merging the physical and the cyber domains a limited number
of papers have explored the idea of modifying the acopf
formulation so that it can integrate the status of the cyber layer
of the cpes one example is the paper presented in 15
where authors propose a cyberconstrained opf model for
the emergency response of smart grids the proposed model
considers both the physical and cyber network by adding
cyberrelated constraints to the traditional acopf but has the
disadvantage of being a blackandwhite mapping process
that assumes the total loss of control of a physical bus mapped
to a cyberblind cyber node cyberblind meaning a cyber
node that becomes invisible due to failing another similar
paper is the one presented in 16 where authors develop a
multiagentbased algorithm designed to optimize the power
ow of a cpes based on power ow constraints derived
from community resilience factors such as levels of emotion
empathy cooperation and physical health of consumers the
community and cyberlayer factors are measured based on
social media sentiment analysis and other social and human
factors related to cognitive science and psychology
a contributions
contrasting from the papers examined this paper aims
to address the specic problem of quantitatively measuring
the realtime cyberphysical security of a cpes considering
factors that affect both its physical and cyber domains by
proposing a novel cybermetric it intends to provide an
intuitive and easytounderstand metric that can be used for
hitl operations and can directly reect the cyberphysical
status of the cpes into the acopf solutions so that the
optimization can be performed not only based on the physicalstatus of the system but considering its current cyber status
the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows
a quantitative cyberphysical security metric for cpes is
proposed the cyberphysical energy system quantita
tive security metric cpesqsm is designed to quantify
the current cyberphysical status of every iotconnected
node in a cpes by combining factors from the electrical
it and graphtheory domains using an mcdm approach
the metric provides an easytointerpret way to evaluate
the current state of the cpes
a cyberconstrained acopf formulation that takes into
account not only the physical state of the system but
also considers the current status of its cyber domain
using the proposed cpesqsm as a proxy is proposed
the formulation is intended to restrict the opf solution
space based on the current cyber status of nodes in
the system which can make them unreliable based on
vulnerabilities or modeled attackgraphs threats targeting
iot devices deployed in the respective nodes of the cpes
experimental case studies are investigated using standard
ieee test systems to demonstrate the usefulness of the
proposed cybermetric and validate the utilization of
the cyberconstrained acopf formulation for achieving
more secure opf solutions ie considering both the
physical and cyber status the results show how the pro
posed formulation improves the security and stability of
the system when a cyberattack compromises vulnerable
nodes

Abstract
This paper examines how Canadian firms balance the benefits of technology adop-
tion against the rising risk of cyber security breaches. We merge data from the 2021
Canadian Survey of Digital Technology and Internet Use and the 2021 Canadian Survey
of Cyber Security and Cybercrime to investigate the trade-off firms face when adopting
digital technologies to enhance productivity and efficiency, balanced against the poten-
tial increase in cyber security risk. The analysis explores the extent of digital technology
adoption, differences across industries, the subsequent impacts on efficiency, and associ-
ated cyber security vulnerabilities. We build aggregate variables, such as the Business
Digital Usage Score and a cyber security incidence variable to quantify each firm’s digital
engagement and cyber security risk. A survey-weight-adjusted Lasso estimator is em-
ployed, and a debiasing method for high-dimensional logit models is introduced to iden-
tify the drivers of technological efficiency and cyber risk. The analysis reveals a digital
divide linked to firm size, industry, and workforce composition. While rapid expansion of
tools such as cloud services or artificial intelligence can raise efficiency, it simultaneously
heightens exposure to cyber threats, particularly among larger enterprises.

1 Introduction
The digital transformation of business operations is reshaping the Canadian economy, offering
opportunities for increased productivity and innovation. For businesses, adopting digital tech-
nologies is no longer optional; it is essential for maintaining competitiveness in a globalized
market. However, with greater reliance on digital tools comes an increased exposure to cyber
security risks. Understanding this trade-off —the efficiency gains from digital adoption versus
the vulnerabilities it introduces is critical for Canadian businesses.
This study examines the extent of digital technology adoption and cyber security prac-
tices among Canadian firms, using a novel dataset that combines information from the 2021
Canadian Survey of Digital Technology and Internet Use (SDTIU) and the 2021 Canadian
Survey of Cyber Security and Cybercrime (CSCSC). To our knowledge, this is the first study
to analyze the most recent version of the CSCSC dataset, offering an opportunity to explore
both digital adoption and cyber security. These surveys provide detailed data on firms’ adop-
tion of advanced technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and enterprise
management systems, as well as the frequency, severity, and impact of cyber security incidents
on business operations.
The primary objective of this paper is to explore the trade-off between digital adoption and
cyber security risk, by examining how technological advancement can enhance productivity
while simultaneously increasing firms’ vulnerability to cyber threats. Specifically, we analyze
which types of firms are adopting digital technologies, how adoption levels vary across indus-
tries, and whether these technologies are increasing cyber security incidents. We also inves-
tigate the firm-specific factors such as size, industry, and employee characteristics that shape
both technological efficiency and the ability to manage cyber security risks. Our methodolog-
ical contributions include introducing the Business Digital Usage Score (BDUS) to quantify
digital adoption, enabling a comparative analysis of firms’ engagement with digital technolo-
gies.
Given the large number of firms and the high dimensionality of mostly qualitative ex-
planatory variables in our dataset, we introduce high-dimensional logit models estimated via
a Lasso-penalized maximum likelihood estimator with survey weights to ensure representa-
tiveness of Canadian firms. We use a debiasing method for inference on the selected model’s
coefficients and establish its asymptotic validity. To assess how closely firms operate to their
technological usage frontier, we apply stochastic frontier analysis. Additionally, we employ k-
means clustering to categorize firms by technological efficiency, facilitating the identification
2
of distinct profiles of digital adoption and efficiency.
The literature on digital technology adoption emphasizes its role in improving firm pro-
ductivity. Larger firms are often better positioned to implement these technologies, benefiting
from economies of scale and greater access to resources (Leung et al., 2008). In contrast,
smaller firms frequently encounter barriers, including high costs of implementation and lim-
ited technical expertise, which can hinder their ability to fully realize the potential benefits
of digital adoption. Ferrari (2012) demonstrates that industry-specific differences in digital
readiness significantly affect adoption rates, while Aghimien et al. (2021) highlight the role
of regional policies in either enabling or constricting firms’ technological advancement. To-
gether, these studies emphasize the structural factors shaping disparities in digital technology
adoption across firms.
In Canada, Bilodeau et al. (2019), using data from the 2017 CSCSC, show the widespread
reliance of Canadian businesses on digital technologies. They report that about 92% of Cana-
dian businesses used one or more digital technologies or services in 2017, with significant
increases in the adoption of websites and social media integration since 2013. In addition,
just over one-fifth of Canadian businesses reported being impacted by cyber security incidents
that affected their operations, with 54% noting that these incidents prevented employees from
carrying out day-to-day work and about 30% experiencing additional repair or recovery costs.
While digital adoption can boost productivity, it also introduces new risks, particularly
related to cyber security. The Geneva Association, a leading international think tank of
the insurance industry, defines cyber risks as breaches in confidentiality, availability, and
data integrity, posing operational threats to firms that increasingly rely on interconnected
digital systems (Eling et al., 2016). Cebula and Young (2010) expand on this definition,
framing cyber risks as disruptions that extend beyond information technology (IT) systems to
affect broader business stability. In Canada, the Toronto Public Library system experienced
significantdisruptionsfollowingacyberattack, whiletheNovaScotiaHealthDepartmentfaced
operational delays and data breaches during a similar event (Bridge and Zoledziowski, 2024;
Bousquet, 2023).
The adoption of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and enterprise
management systems could increase cyber security risks. Blichfeldt and Faullant (2021) high-
light that while these systems can improve productivity, their complexity often introduces
integration challenges that, if poorly managed, can undermine business operations. Addition-
ally, the widespread use of interconnected devices has expanded the potential attack surface
for cybercriminals, requiring firms to invest more heavily in cyber security infrastructure.
3
Remote work adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the reliance on digital
tools but also introduced new risks and challenges. Hackney et al. (2022) find that firms
effectively utilizing digital technologies during the pandemic demonstrated resilience in main-
taining operations under lockdown conditions. However, Aczel et al. (2021) and Kitagawa
et al. (2021) report that the rapid shift to remote work led to heightened employee burnout
and increased risks of phishing attacks, underscoring the broader implications of accelerated
digital adoption.
Cyber insurance is a tool for mitigating cyber security risks. According to the OECD
(OECD, 2017), the cyber insurance market doubled in size between 2015 and 2020, fueled by
firms’ increasing awareness of cyber threats. However, Fitch Ratings (Fitch Ratings, 2021)
highlights that high premiums and restrictive coverage policies hinder adoption, especially
among smaller firms. Globally, cyber security spending is projected to surpass $170 billion by
2026 (Gartner, Inc., 2021).
Despite the growing demand for cyber insurance, firms may strategically underinvest in
cyber security measures due to the unobservable nature of such investments. Ahnert et al.
(2022) argue that firms may prioritize visible innovations over less transparent risk mitigation
strategies, as clients are often unable to directly evaluate cyber security expenditures. This
dynamic creates a paradox in which firms recognize the increasing risks of digital adoption
but fail to allocate sufficient resources to mitigate them effectively.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the datasets used in the study, the
SDTIU and the CSCSC, as well as the construction of the associated scores and variables.
Section 3 outlines the paper’s main contribution and methodological framework: the survey-
weighted debiased logit Lasso method. Section 4 presents the empirical results, discussing the
key determinants of technological efficiency and cyber security vulnerabilities. We conclude
in Section 5 with a discussion of the implications of our findings for Canadian businesses
and policymakers. The appendix is divided into two parts: Appendix A provides additional
technical details on the survey-weighted debiased logit Lasso model, and Appendix B outlines
the questions that comprise the BDUS and the Cyber Security Incidence indicator.
2 Data Description and Variable Construction
The empirical analysis is based on a merged dataset from two Statistics Canada surveys: the
2021 SDTIU and the 2021 CSCSC. These surveys were merged using firm size and industry
4
classifications from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), enabling an
integrated study of digital adoption and cyber security risks among Canadian businesses.1
The SDTIU focuses on digital technology adoption, including metrics such as internet
usage, e-commerceparticipation, andICTadoption, whiletheCSCSCexaminescybersecurity
practices and the impact of cyber incidents on businesses. The merged dataset includes both
qualitative variables, such as the implementation of specific technologies and cyber security
measures, and quantitative variables, such as cyber security expenditure and incident-related
costs. Together, the surveys cover numerous variables relevant to digital adoption and cyber
security. The firms vary in size, ranging from small enterprises with fewer than 10 employees
to large corporations with over 500 employees. The industries covered include manufacturing,
retail, professional services, and information technology.
Both surveys apply stratified sampling by industry and firm size, with survey weights
correctingforselectionprobabilities,non-responses,andsamplingbiases. Theseweightsensure
that the results are representative of the broader population of Canadian enterprises. The
SDTIU achieved a response rate of 73%, while the CSCSC had a response rate of 65%. The
pre-matched weighted samples cover 327,567 enterprises for the SDTIU and 185,644 for the
CSCSC. After merging, the final dataset comprises a weighted sample of 179,657 enterprises,
ensuring comprehensive coverage across various business demographics.
Below, we introduce aggregate measures of digital technology usage: BDUS in Section
2.1, a separate measure of Business Technological Efficiency (based on k-means clustering) in
Section 2.2, which examines whether firms encounter significant challenges in implementing
the technologies they adopt, and an indicator for Cyber Security Incidence in Section 2.3.
2.1 Business Digital Usage Score
The BDUS is a quantitative variable constructed to evaluate the digital engagement of Cana-
dian firms by measuring the technologies they have adopted. It condenses responses from the
2021 SDTIU into a single, interpretable score that reflects the cumulative utilization of digital
tools across ten distinct domains, such as cloud computing, digital payment systems, artifi-
cial intelligence (AI), smart devices, online sales, government digital connectivity, fiber-optic
internet, and company websites (see Appendix B for the exact questions).
1Methodological differences between the surveys include variations in enterprise size definitions (for small
firms: SDTIUdefinessmallfirmsasthosewith5–49employees, whileCSCSCdefinesthemas10–49employees)
and potential differences in primary respondents’ understanding of their enterprise’s operations. Additionally,
the surveys differ in target populations, including NAICS and enterprise size requirements.
5
For each of the ten domains, we create a binary variable equal to 1 if the firm reports using
that technology. Summing these indicators yields a score between 0 and 10, with higher values
indicating more extensive digital engagement. Although it is conceivable that advanced tech-
nologies (e.g., AI) have disproportionate impacts on firm productivity compared to simpler
ones (e.g., a basic website), weighting them by perceived importance would introduce addi-
tional assumptions. Firms also have heterogeneous technological needs, some rely heavily on
cloud computing for scalable data storage, while others benefit more from online payment sys-
tems or data analytics. Therefore uniform summation provides a transparent, easily replicable
index of a firm’s overall digital footprint.

Figure 1: Histogram of Business Digital Usage Scores
Figure 1 shows the distribution of BDUS scores. The majority of firms fall within scores
of 3 to 7, suggesting moderate overall adoption levels, with mild peaks at 4 and 6. At the
extremes, a small proportion of firms report virtually no digital engagement (score = 0),
whereas another small subset achieves near-comprehensive adoption (scores of 9 or 10). This
dispersion highlights the heterogeneity of adoption patterns: some businesses implement only
a handful of relevant technologies, while others adopt a wide array.
It is important to note that the BDUS does not measure the intensity of usage or the ease
of integration. Rather, it provides a concise snapshot of whether certain well-known tools have
been adopted in at least a basic form. We use the BDUS to investigate the characteristics
of firms that adopt digital technologies through a stochastic frontier model in Section 4,
measuring how close businesses are to their technological frontier. Additionally, we use the
BDUS to assess whether having a more extensive digital profile correlates with cyber risk
exposure (Table 1).
6
2.2 Business Technological Efficiency
While the BDUS captures which digital technologies firms adopt, it does not gauge how well
these technologies are integrated. To address this, we construct a measure of Technological
Efficiency by applying a k-means clustering algorithm to a set of SDTIU survey items about
technological implementation challenges. Specifically, these survey items parallel the BDUS
domains but ask whether the firm experiences difficulties using each technology, whereas the
BDUS questions simply ask if firms use each technology. The exact questions used in this
clustering exercise are listed in Appendix B.
Let{zi1,zi2,...,zi10}be binary indicators for firm i, capturing whether it reports a chal-
lenge in each of the ten domains. A response of “Yes” indicates an operational problem in
using the technology associated with that domain. We apply k-means clustering to these
ten binary variables and determine that k= 2is the optimal cluster count, resulting in two
groups:Digitally Efficient andNot Digitally Efficient . Figure 2 displays the percentage of
reported challenges in each domain for these two clusters. Firms in the latter cluster (52,505
businesses) report significantly more issues than those in the former (127,152 businesses). For
example, 70.71% of Not Digitally Efficient firms cite difficulties with AI, compared to 23.58%
in theDigitally Efficient group. Similarly, 57.55% of Not Digitally Efficient firms encounter
challenges with cloud computing, versus only 3.21% among Digitally Efficient firms.
The high incidence of challenges among Not Digitally Efficient firms does not imply that
they fail to adopt these tools. Some businesses report both a high BDUS score (indicating
widespread adoption) and frequent operational issues, suggesting partial or suboptimal imple-
mentation. Even in the Digitally Efficient cluster, a non-trivial share of firms faces difficulties
in at least one domain.
Thisk-means classification yields a binary variable, Technological Efficiency, which we use
as a dependent variable in one of the logit models in Section 4. Whereas the BDUS measures
the extent of adoption, the Technological Efficiency grouping reflects the firm’s ability to use
the technology effectively. In this sense, the two measures are complementary: the BDUS
indicates how many digital tools a firm adopts, while the logit model using the Technological
Efficiency variable reveals whether the adopted technologies are being used efficiently.
2.3 Cyber Security Incidence
To examine the cyber security challenges faced by Canadian businesses, we construct a set of

primary variable, Cyber Security Incidence , indicates whether a business was affected by any
cyber security incident in 2021. This binary variable is coded as 1 if the business reported
experiencing one or more types of cyber security incidents, and 0 otherwise. These incidents
range from theft of assets, business data, or intellectual property to disruptions of business
activities. Of the 179,656 surveyed firms, 39,524 (22%) reported at least one such incident,
while the remaining 140,132 (78%) reported none.
Figure 3 shows the occurrence of these incident types among the 39,524 firms that experi-
enced any cyber incident. The most frequently cited issues included incidents to steal money
or demand ransom payment (37%), incidents with an unknown motive (39%), incidents to
steal personal or financial information (33%), incidents to disrupt or deface the business or
web presence (18%), and incidents to access unauthorised or privileged areas (20%). Fewer
respondents reported incidents to steal or manipulate intellectual property or business data
(9.8%) and incidents to monitor and track business activity (9.2%).
We use this binary Cyber Security Incidence variable in subsequent analyses for two pri-
mary reasons. It serves as a dependent variable in the cyber security incidence logit model
(Section 4), where we identify which firm characteristics and digital adoption practices predict
a higher likelihood of experiencing an incident. The Cyber Security Incidence variable is also

included as a regressor in our stochastic frontier analysis to examine whether having experi-
enced a breach correlates with digital technology usage. The rationale is that a prior cyber
incident may influence firms’ subsequent decisions or capabilities regarding digital adoption
and security investments. A full list of cyber incidence types appears in Appendix B.
3 Estimation Methodology: Survey Weighted Debiased
Lasso
To estimate models predicting technological efficiency and cyber security incidents, we employ
a survey-weighted logistic Lasso (hereafter svy LLasso ) estimation technique and introduce
a debiasing method for inference. This approach is well-suited to our analysis, as it effectively
handles high-dimensional data and incorporates a diverse set of variables, including digital
technologyusage, cybersecuritypractices, andfirmcharacteristics. OurprimaryLassomodels
include over 50 independent variables, while second-order interaction models expand to more
than 200 variables.
To accurately represent the population of Canadian businesses, we adapt the standard
logistic Lasso method to incorporate Statistics Canada survey weights. To this end, we define
9
the following general ℓ1-penalized maximum likelihood estimator for a Generalized Linear
Model with survey weights, where the svy LLasso estimator is a special case:
ˆθ= argmin
θ=(α,β′)′∈Rp+1
−Ln(θ) +λp/summationdisplay
j=1|βj|
,
where:
•θ= (α,β′)′includes the intercept αand coefficients β∈Rp,
•Ln(θ) =−n−1/summationtextn
i=1wig(yi,x′
iθ)is the survey-weighted log-likelihood, where g(y,x′θ)is
the negative log-density function (see Appendix A.2 for a detailed description), xiis the
regressor vector for firm i,yiis the outcome variable, and wiis the survey weight,
•λ/summationtextp
j=1|βj|is the penalty term, with tuning parameter λ, enforcing sparsity by shrinking
less relevant coefficients to zero.
For our logit models, this approach selects the variables most predictive of technological effi-
ciency and cyber security incidents while accounting for survey weights. This framework was
adopted by Jasiak and Tuvaandorj (2023) and Jasiak et al. (2024), with the former developing
an inference method different from the one we consider below.
InferenceviaDebiasing. Forstatisticalinferenceonmodelparametersandaveragemarginal
effects (AME) (Appendix A.1), we adapt the debiased Lasso method from Zhang and Zhang
(2014)andJavanmardandMontanari(2014)tothesurveycontextdescribedabove. Giventhe
ℓ1-penalized maximum likelihood estimator ˆθ, the debiasing (DB) method applies a one-step
correction:
˜θ=ˆθ+ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(ˆθ),
where ˆH(ˆθ)andS(ˆθ)arethenegativeHessianandscorefunctionoftheweightedlog-likelihood
functionLn(θ). The adjustment term ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(ˆθ)corrects the bias introduced by the ℓ1-
penalized variable selection, enabling reliable inference. This variant, which uses the standard
Hessian, follows Xia et al. (2023), who consider standard GLMs, adapted here for survey
weights. We estimate the asymptotic variance of n1/2S(θ0)using a sample information matrix
ˆI(ˆθ)(see Appendix A.2), where θ0represents the unknown true values of θ.
For a nonlinear parameter function ρ(θ)(anr×1vector, possibly n-dependent), e.g., the
AME, we define the debiased estimator:
10
˜ρ=ρ(ˆθ) + ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(ˆθ),˙ρ(θ) =∂ρ(θ)′
∂θ. (3.1)
Asymptotic Validity. We establish the asymptotic validity of Wald-type inference in the
following proposition. To keep the exposition simple, the underlying framework, definitions,
and assumptions are provided in Appendix A.
Proposition 3.1 (Asymptotic Validity of Survey Debiasing Estimator) .Let Assumption 1
hold, and assume that
•λ=C/radicalig

•p2/n→0, andm0logp/radicaligp

coefficients of θ0,
•ρ(θ)(with fixedr<p +1) is differentiable near θ0with a locally Lipschitz Jacobian ˙ρ(θ),
andλmin( ˙ρ(θ0)′˙ρ(θ0))>λl>0, whereλmindenotes the minimum eigenvalue.

The proof is provided in Appendix A.3. The order of the tuning parameter λis standard
in the literature (Bühlmann and van de Geer, 2011; Negahban et al., 2012; van de Geer et al.,
2014; Hastie et al., 2015). The assumptions on the number of covariates pand model sparsity
m0align with those in Xia et al. (2023). In particular, the condition m0logp/radicalig
p/n→0
is stronger than the condition m0logp√n→0assumed by van de Geer et al. (2014). However,
unlike van de Geer et al. (2014), no direct assumption is imposed on the sparsity of the inverse
Hessian (or information matrix).
The assumption of a locally Lipschitz Jacobian ˙ρ(θ)is slightly stronger than the usual con-
tinuous differentiability condition required for testing nonlinear hypotheses (see, e.g., Newey
and McFadden (1994, Section 9) and Hansen (2022 a,b)). Under this assumption, the estima-
tion error arising from the estimation of θ0andρ(θ0)becomes negligible.
Using this proposition, we make inference on the parameters θ0andρ(θ0). In sum, the
debiasing approach above offers a straightforward and robust way to analyze high-dimensional
survey data, ensuring both variable selection and valid inference in the presence of survey
weights.

4 Empirical Results
The empirical analysis examines the relationship between digital technology adoption and
cyber security vulnerabilities among Canadian businesses. We begin by assessing whether
broader digital adoption correlates with increased cyber risk (Section 4.1) using rank corre-
lations between the BDUS and various security measures. Next, we estimate a Stochastic
Frontier Analysis (SFA) model (Section 4.2), treating the BDUS as an “output” to identify
which factors drive a firm toward its digital usage frontier. We then employ logit models with
Lasso selection for two binary outcomes: Technological Efficiency (Section 4.3) and Cyber
Security Incidence (Section 4.4), allowing us to determine whether the same firm characteris-
tics or digital practices that foster greater adoption also enhance implementation efficiency or
increase cyber vulnerability.
The sample sizes for the analyses are as follows: the svy LLasso results for business ef-
ficiency are based on a weighted sample of 175,428 businesses, excluding those with a BDUS
score less than 2. The cyber security incidence model uses the full merged dataset, encompass-
ing 179,657 businesses. The svy LLasso procedure is implemented using R, where we utilize
the default value of the tuning parameter λfrom the Rpackage glmnet(see Appendix A.1).
4.1 Digital Technology Adoption and Cyber Security
We explore whether a broader digital presence for a firm correlates with heightened cyber risk.
Table 1 reports polychoric and polyserial correlations between the BDUS (an ordinal score
from 0 to 10) that measures the amount of technology a firm has adopted and various cyber
security measures, including firms cyber security spending (continuous variable), a binary
indicator for whether or not a firm experienced a cyber incident, and whether or not a firm
paid ransom as a result of a cyber security breach. We use polychoric correlation for ordinal
to binary comparisons and polyserial correlation for the ordinal to continuous comparison.
The positive and significant correlation between BDUS and both cyber security spending
(ρ= 0.156∗∗∗) and experiencing an incident ( ρ= 0.083∗∗∗) suggests that while digitally en-
gaged firms invest more in security, they also face greater exposure to attacks. Firms with
a higher BDUS are also more likely to have to pay a ransom as a result of a cyber security
breach (ρ= 0.266∗∗∗). The absence of any cyber security measures correlates negatively with
BDUS (ρ=−0.068∗∗∗), indicating that firms with minimal digital footprints may perceive
fewer threats but also forgo basic protective actions.

Notes:The table reports polychoric correlations for ordinal–binary comparisons and polyserial correlations

significant at the 1% level. Significance levels: *** p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0.10. Sample size: 179,657.
These correlations provide preliminary evidence of a trade-off: as firms adopt more digital
tools (higher BDUS), they may both allocate more resources to cyber security and become
more frequent targets of attacks. This finding motivates the proceeding empirical analyses.
4.2 Digital Technology Adoption by Canadian Businesses
We estimate an SFA model to examine which firm-level and industry-level characteristics
bring businesses closer to their “digital usage frontier.” Treating BDUS (a quantitative score
0–10) as an “output” — that is, the extent to which a firm adopts digital tools — allows us
to separate random variation from systematic shortfalls in adoption. The frontier approach
is particularly useful because some firms may lag in adopting new technologies for reasons
beyond mere chance (e.g., internal constraints or strategic decisions). In this specification, a
positive coefficient indicates that the corresponding variable moves firms closer to the frontier
of digital adoption.
Table 2 presents the maximum likelihood estimates for the logistic SFA model. We use
a logistic specification to account for the bounded nature of BDUS, recognizing that moving
from, for example, two to three adopted technologies represents a more substantial increase
in digital capacity than moving from eight to nine. The explanatory variables are grouped
into three categories: Firm characteristics ,Digital technologies , andCyber security measures .
After controlling for industry fixed effects, the estimated mean efficiency score across all firms
is 77%, suggesting that while most businesses integrate some digital tools, gaps remain.

facturing (0.043∗∗∗) andArts/Accommodation/Food (0.106∗∗∗) both exceed the baseline cate-
gory ofProfessional services .
For cyber security measures, the share of Female employees in ICT roles (0.002∗∗∗) is the
only strongly significant predictor, indicating that a higher percentage of women in ICT corre-
lates with greater digital adoption. The variance parameter estimates confirm that systematic
inefficiency ( σu) dominates random noise ( σv), suggesting that much of the under-adoption of
digital tools is rooted in structural constraints rather than chance.
These results imply that resource capacity (firm size), remote-work arrangements, and the
availabilityofspecificdigitaltoolsormanagerialpractices(e.g., opensource, clientinformation
management) can propel Canadian firms closer to their feasible frontier of technology usage.
Industries such as Construction or Education/Health appear to face adoption barriers, while
manufacturing and consumer-facing sectors integrate digital tools more readily. Although
extensive digital adoption may heighten cyber threats (Section 4.1), most of the cyber security
variables analyzed here do not notably influence how far along a firm is on the adoption curve.
4.3 Technological Efficiency of Canadian Businesses
The SFA analysis, using BDUS as the dependent variable in Section 4.2, measures the extent
of digital adoption but does not capture how effectively these tools are utilized. To address
this distinction, we introduce a binary variable for Technological Efficiency , derived through
k-means clustering. This clustering algorithm categorizes firms based on whether they report
few or many operational difficulties in using adopted technologies. A firm is classified as
“Technologically Efficient” if it experiences relatively few challenges across multiple domains
(see Section 2 for details). We restrict the sample to businesses with BDUS ≥2, ensuring a
baseline level of digital engagement prior to evaluating efficiency.
Table 3 presents the svy LLasso results for the probability of a firm being Technologically
Efficient. The independent variables are grouped into three categories: Firm characteristics ,
Digital technologies , andCyber security measures . A positive coefficient indicates that the

using digital tools efficiently. Medium (]AMEDB= 0.158∗∗∗) andLarge(]AMEDB= 0.102∗∗∗)
firms exhibit higher AME relative to Smallfirms.Remote work (]AMEDB= 0.139∗∗∗) is also

andBig data analytics (]AMEDB= 0.076∗∗)bothshowstrongpositiveeffects, whileadvertising
efforts, such as free advertising ( ]AMEDB= 0.073∗∗), also correlate with efficient usage. For
industries, Arts/Accommodation/Food (]AMEDB= 0.146∗∗∗) andEducation/Health show a
positive marginal effect ( ]AMEDB= 0.113∗∗∗) compared to Professional services .
Firms endowed with more resources, due to scale (medium or large size) or operational flex-
ibility (remote work) can allocate staff and capital to integrate digital systems more effectively.
Real-time connectivity from IoT and big data appears to reinforce structured work flows, while
advertising activities may align with better-organized digital platforms. Consumer-facing in-
dustries, such as Arts/Accommodation/Food may capitalize on digital marketing tools or
consumer facing technologies such as reservation systems more readily than sectors facing
heavier regulatory or operational barriers.
The variables that reduce the likelihood of efficient digital implementation include Elec-
tronic data interchange (]AMEDB=−0.101∗∗∗) andEnterprise resource planning (]AMEDB=
−0.168∗∗). The AME values suggest that more complex systems can pose challenges with
technological adoption. The Manufacturing industry ( ]AMEDB=−0.065∗∗) has a negative
effect based on AMEs, while certain cyber security variables, such as Employee monitoring
(]AMEDB=−0.184∗∗∗), also correlate negatively with Technological Efficiency.
These negative or insignificant AMEs point to organizational or regulatory factors that can
undermine digital adoption benefits. Complex software solutions (EDI, ERP) often require
robust training and IT resources; without sufficient support, firms may experience integration
hurdles. Industries like Mining/Utilities/Construction may face specialized work flows or
17
regulatorystricturesthatmayobstructrapiddigitalplatformadoption. Certaincybersecurity
practices (employee monitoring) can introduce procedural friction or negative employment
sentiment that overshadows efficiency gains if not carefully managed.
4.4 Cyber Security Incidence
The determinants of Cyber Security Incidence variable are analyzed using a binary dependent
variable introduced in Section 2. The Cyber Security Incidence variable equals 1 if a firm
reported experiencing at least one cyber security incident during 2021, and 0 otherwise; among
179,656 surveyed firms, 32,371 (18.0%) reported an incident. Cyber incidents encompass
a range of adverse events, including theft of business assets, data breaches, disruptions to
business activities, intellectual property losses, and other cyber-related issues. Although a
large number of independent variables are included in the analysis, relatively few emerge as
statistically significant predictors, indicating that cyber risk is shaped by a limited subset of
factors.

Table 4 displays the svy LLasso estimates for the probability of experiencing a cyber
security incident. Among the variables with positive and statistically significant associa-
tions are being a large firm ( ]AMEDB= 0.057∗∗) and adopting confidential cloud solutions
(]AMEDB= 0.067∗∗∗). In addition, certain industry categories Mining/Utilities/Construction,
Manufacturing, Wholesale/Retail/Transport, and Other services exhibit statistically signifi-
cant positive coefficients.
Two factors show negative and statistically significant effects on the likelihood of a cyber
incident. Having over 60% female employees in cyber security roles ( ]AMEDB=−0.056∗)
and holding cyber security insurance ( ]AMEDB=−0.043∗) are both associated with lower
probabilities of experiencing an incident.
These results suggest that larger enterprises may face heightened cyber risks, potentially
reflecting the extensive data infrastructures and more valuable assets characteristic of bigger
firms. Reliance on confidential cloud solutions might increase exposure to attacks, as remote
and cloud-based systems use electronic methods to store data. Lower incidence rates among
firms with higher proportions of female cyber security personnel could indicate that diverse
cyber teams are more adept at preventing or responding to threats. Likewise, the negative
association of cyber security insurance with incidence likelihood hints that insured firms may
adopt more robust preventive strategies to manage their risk profiles.
4.5 Interaction Effects
UsinganadaptiveLassoapproachwithpolynomialexpansions, weinvestigatewhethersecond-
order (interaction) terms enhance the predictive accuracy of our Technological Efficiency and
Cyber Security Incidence specifications. We estimate both a first-order (linear) model and a
second-order model that includes all pairwise interactions among the explanatory variables.
See Bühlmann and van de Geer (2011) for the theoretical background.
Table 5 reports mean-squared cross-validation (CV) errors under each specification, along
with the penalty parameter λcv. For the Technological Efficiency model, allowing second-
order terms substantially lowers the CV error, suggesting that interactions play an important
role in explaining efficiency gains from digital technologies. In the Cyber Security Incidence
model, the simpler first-order specification yields a slightly lower CV error, indicating that
20
higher-order interactions do not improve predictions of cyber security incidence likelihood.
A second-order polynomial specification is justified for the Technological Efficiency model,
therefore we re-estimate the svy LLasso model with interaction terms involving firm size,
remote work, key technologies, and industry classifications. Table 6 shows the significant
interaction terms selected by the svy LLasso estimator, along with their debiased parameter
estimates ˜θDBandp-values. Only the interaction coefficients that were selected by the Lasso
and statistically significant at the 5% level are included in Table 6.

Notes:The table shows the mean-squared CV error from an adaptive Lasso specification with polynomial
expansions of different degrees (1 = linear, 2 = second-order interactions). For each model, λcvdenotes the
penalty parameter that minimizes the CV error. Based on these metrics, the second-order polynomial is
preferred for the Technological Efficiency model, while a first-order specification is preferred for the Cyber
Security Incidence model. Sample size: 179,657.

Medium-sized firms benefit from adopting IoT solutions and online platforms, likely due to
greater resource availability compared to smaller firms. Remote work enhances the efficiency

sectors. Conversely, interactions like online sales with wholesale, retail, and transport are
negatively associated with firm technological efficiency.

5 Conclusion
This paper contributes new evidence on how Canadian businesses navigate the trade-off be-
tween digital technology adoption and heightened cyber security risk. Using data from Statis-
tics Canada’s SDTIU and CSCSC surveys, we construct a BDUS to gauge overall adoption
levels and then evaluate how effectively businesses use these tools by modeling their technolog-
ical efficiency. In addition, we employ a survey-weight-adjusted Lasso estimator and introduce
a debiasing method for high-dimensional logit models to identify the drivers of technological
efficiency and cybersecurity risk.
The stochastic frontier analysis suggests that larger firms, remote work arrangements, and
specific advanced technologies (e.g., open-source solutions, client information management
systems) can push a firm closer to its digital “frontier.” At the same time, a portion of
businesses lag behind feasible adoption levels, as indicated by the high ratio of inefficiency to
noise in the frontier estimations.
Firmsmustbalanceefficiencygainsagainstgrowingcybervulnerabilities. Firmsthatadopt
more sophisticated digital technologies or store sensitive data in the cloud often face elevated
risk exposure. Our svy LLasso model on cyber incidence confirm that large firms and those
using cloud-based services are more likely to report cyber security incidents. However, the pre-
dictive power of cyber risk does not improve with second-order interaction effects, suggesting
that firm size and core technological choices are the primary drivers of cyber exposure. The
two main variables that decreased the likelihood of cyber incidents were firms having cyber
security insurance and firms that had a high representation of females in cyber security roles.
When it comes to technological efficiency simple linear relationships fail to capture the
complexity of how organizational choices, workforce composition, and industry shape digital
outcomes. By allowing second-order (interaction) terms, the svy LLasso approach shows that
certain combinations of variables such as medium firms adopting IoT, or female ICT repre-
sentation interacting with advanced tools like AI can be particularly conducive to efficiency
improvements. On the other hand, friction in implementing complex software like EDI or
ERP can negate some of these benefits.
The analysis demonstrates the importance of firm size and industry. While small firms
are sometimes more “locally efficient,” the resource advantages of larger organizations may
facilitate deeper or more comprehensive integration of technologies. Industries also differ sub-
stantially. In resource- and asset-intensive sectors such as Mining or Construction, strong
positive interactions emerge between targeted digital solutions and improved operational pro-
24
cesses, whereas compliance-heavy fields like Education and Health exhibit more negative or
complex relationships.
Gender composition in ICT roles has meaningful consequences for digital adoption out-
comes. Although our results do not prove a causal mechanism, the recurring positive coeffi-
cients on interactions involving a share of female ICT staff and advanced technologies suggest
that even partial gender diversity in technical teams can amplify the returns to adopting new
tools. This pattern is also seen in broader research suggesting that heterogeneity in skill sets
and perspectives can catalyze creative problem-solving.
The results highlight the balance firms must strike between achieving efficiency gains from
digital technologies and managing increased cyber risks. Larger, digitally advanced firms ap-
proach their efficiency frontier yet face elevated cyber vulnerability, especially when security
practices fall short. Remote work arrangements enhance both digital adoption and techno-
logical efficiency without increasing cyber risk exposure. Female representation in ICT and
cyber security roles consistently improves outcomes across adoption, efficiency, and cyber se-
curity. Certain cyber security practices, particularly obtaining cyber security insurance and
ensuring gender diversity within cyber security roles significantly reduce incident likelihood.
Reliance on cloud-based services, notably confidential cloud storage, emerges as a risk factor
increasing cyber vulnerability. These results suggest policymakers should implement targeted
digital strategies tailored by industry and firm size to boost technological efficiency, while
simultaneously establishing baseline cyber security practices such as insurance coverage and
workforce diversity to mitigate cyber threats effectively.

Tuning Parameter Selection. In the empirical analysis and the small Monte Carlo simu-
lations below, the logit Lasso model svyLLasso is fitted using the Rpackage glmnet. For the
tuning parameter λ, we use the package’s default value, determined by 10-fold cross-validation
with the loss function auc(area under the ROC curve).
Average marginal effect in the logit model. We report the marginal effects (ME) for
each variable along with the coefficient estimates for logit models in the tables. Let Λ(z) =
exp(z)/(1 + exp(z))be the logistic distribution function. For a dummy regressor ˜xij, where
j= 1,...,pandi= 1,...,n, the ME is defined as:
MEij(θ)≡Λ(x′
iθ)|˜xij=1−Λ(x′
iθ)|˜xij=0.
Given the survey weights {wi}n
i=1corresponding to the observations {(yi,x′
i)′}n
i=1, the AME of
thej-th regressor is given by:
AMEj=AMEj(θ0)≡E/bracketleftigg1

i=1win/summationdisplay
i=1wiMEij(θ0)/bracketrightigg
,
whereθ0is the true parameter value, and the expectation is with respect to the regressors’
distribution. An estimator for AME jis:

whereθ0is the true value of the parameter vector θ∈Rp+1, anda(·)andc(·)are known
functions. The combined SDTIU and CSCSC data were collected using a stratified sampling
scheme, wherein units within each stratum are sampled independently with equal probability.
In line with this, we treat wias fixed (see Wooldridge, 2001), and assume {(yi,x′

Letg(y,x′θ)≡−logf(y,x′θ)and define the weighted log-likelihood function as:

(A.1) are defined as

Moreover, we define H(θ0)≡E[ˆH(θ0)]andI(θ0)≡E[ˆI(θ0)].
We will using the following notations in the assumptions and the proof of Proposition 3.1
below. Let λmin(A)andλmax(A)denote the smallest and the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric
matrixA, respectively. For a real matrix A= (aij), let∥A∥∞≡maxi,j|aij|, and∥A∥=/radicalig
tr(A′A)and∥A∥2=/radicalig
λmax(A′A)denote its Frobenius and spectral norms, respectively. The
sub-Gaussian norm of a random variable Xis defined as∥X∥ψ2≡supm≥1m−1/2(E[|X|m])1/m.
The sub-Gaussian norm for the random vector is defined as ∥X∥ψ2≡sup∥b∥=1∥X′b∥ψ2.
We establish the asymptotic validity of the debiasing method under the following assump-
tions imposed directly on the negative log-density function g(y,t)which are similar to the
assumptions employed in van de Geer et al. (2014) and Xia et al. (2023). Let X= [x1,...,xn]′.

Simulations. We conduct a simulation experiment to verify the robustness of the debiased
logit Lasso inference. We first generate N= 10,000draws from a standard logit model as
follows:
yi∼Bernoulli(πi), (A.9)
whereθ0= (1,1,1,01×(p−2))′,˜xij∼i.i.d. Bernoulli(0.5)forj= 1,...,pandi= 1,...,N,

The population is then stratified into four strata of sizes 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000.
Fromeachstratum, wedraw50and100observationswithreplacement, yieldingstratifiedsam-
ples of size n= 200andn= 400, respectively. Observation weights are wi= 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,
corresponding to the four strata. To evaluate the impact of regressor dimensionality, we set
psuch thatp
n∈{0.01,0.025,0.05,0.1,0.25,0.5}for eachn∈{200,400}. The true AME for
θ(2)=β1is 0.11.

We assess the empirical size of the tests by separately testing two null hypotheses:
H0:θ(2)= 1, H 0: AME 2= 0.11. (A.10)
The empirical sizes of the DB test and the standard survey t-test (tsvy) at the 5% nominal
level are presented in the table below. The standard survey logit tsvytest overrejects by a wide
margin, while the DB test exhibits reasonably accurate null rejection rates for both hypotheses
in most cases, confirming its robustness to regressor dimensionality.

A.3 Proof of Proposition 3.1
We first prove the following lemma, which establishes the asymptotic distribution of a studen-
tized quantity involving the expected Hessian and information matrices, as well as the score
function, all evaluated at the true parameters.

First note that E[Xni] = 0because E[si(θ0)|xi] =−E[xiwi(yi−˙a(x′

This verifies (A.11) and the result follows.
Proof of Proposition 3.1 By the mean value expansion,
S(θ0) =S(ˆθ) +ˆH(θ∗)(ˆθ−θ0) =S(ˆθ) +ˆH(ˆθ)(ˆθ−θ0) +R, (A.13)
whereθ∗is the mean-value between ˆθandθ0, andR= [R1,...,Rp+1]′with

i=1(¨g(yi,x′

Note that since ˙ρ(θ)is locally Lipschitz in a neighborhood of θ0, with probability approaching
1∥˙ρ(¯θ)−˙ρ(ˆθ)∥≤B0∥¯θ−ˆθ∥for someB0=O(1). Also, since
n1/2(ρ(ˆθ)−ρ(θ0)) = ˙ρ(¯θ)′n1/2(ˆθ−θ0), (A.15)
where ¯θis a mean-value between ˆθandθ0, we have
n1/2∥˙ρ(ˆθ)−˙ρ(¯θ)∥∥ˆθ−θ0∥=n1/2B0∥ˆθ−¯θ∥∥ˆθ−θ0∥=Op(n1/2m0λ2)
=op(1), (A.16)
where the last line is by n1/2m0λ2=n−1/2m0C2logp≤C2m0(p/n)1/2logp=o(1). Then,
n1/2(˜ρ−ρ(θ0))
=n1/2(ρ(ˆθ)−ρ(θ0)) + ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1n1/2S(ˆθ)
34

=n1/2˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0)−n1/2˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1R+op(1),
where the first equality is by the definition of ˜ρ, the second equality is by (A.13) and (A.15),
and the third is by (A.16). Below, the proof will be completed in three steps: the first two
steps establish
˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1ˆI(ˆθ)ˆH(ˆθ)−1˙ρ(ˆθ)−˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1˙ρ(θ0) =op(1),
n1/2˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0)−n1/2˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1S(θ0) =op(1), (A.17)
and the third step verifies n1/2˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1R=op(1). It will then follow that

Finally, applying Lemma A.1 of and Slutsky’s lemma give the desired result.

First, by the triangle inequality
∥˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1ˆI(ˆθ)ˆH(ˆθ)−1˙ρ(ˆθ)−˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1˙ρ(θ0)∥2

Consider the first term on the right-hand side of (A.18). By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,

=∥(ˆH(ˆθ)−1−H(θ0)−1)ˆI(ˆθ)ˆH(ˆθ)−1+H(θ0)−1(ˆI(ˆθ)ˆH(ˆθ)−1−I(θ0)H(θ0)−1)∥2,

Therefore, the quantity in (A.19) is op(1). Consider the second term on the right-hand side of

The Cyber Security Incidence variable is equal to 1 if a firm answers “Yes” to one of the
following questions and 0 otherwise.
To the best of your knowledge, which cyber security incidents impacted your busi-
ness in 2021? Select all that apply.
•Incidents to disrupt or deface the business or web presence.
•Incidents to steal personal or financial information.
•Incidents to steal money or demand ransom payment.
•Incidents to steal or manipulate intellectual property or business data.
•Incidents to access unauthorised or privileged areas.
•Incidents to monitor and track business activity.
•Incidents with an unknown motive.

1 introduction
the digital transformation of business operations is reshaping the canadian economy offering
opportunities for increased productivity and innovation for businesses adopting digital tech
nologies is no longer optional it is essential for maintaining competitiveness in a globalized
market however with greater reliance on digital tools comes an increased exposure to cyber
security risks understanding this tradeoff the efficiency gains from digital adoption versus
the vulnerabilities it introduces is critical for canadian businesses
this study examines the extent of digital technology adoption and cyber security prac
tices among canadian firms using a novel dataset that combines information from the 2021
canadian survey of digital technology and internet use sdtiu and the 2021 canadian
survey of cyber security and cybercrime cscsc to our knowledge this is the first study
to analyze the most recent version of the cscsc dataset offering an opportunity to explore
both digital adoption and cyber security these surveys provide detailed data on firms adop
tion of advanced technologies such as cloud computing artificial intelligence and enterprise
management systems as well as the frequency severity and impact of cyber security incidents
on business operations
the primary objective of this paper is to explore the tradeoff between digital adoption and
cyber security risk by examining how technological advancement can enhance productivity
while simultaneously increasing firms vulnerability to cyber threats specifically we analyze
which types of firms are adopting digital technologies how adoption levels vary across indus
tries and whether these technologies are increasing cyber security incidents we also inves
tigate the firmspecific factors such as size industry and employee characteristics that shape
both technological efficiency and the ability to manage cyber security risks our methodolog
ical contributions include introducing the business digital usage score bdus to quantify
digital adoption enabling a comparative analysis of firms engagement with digital technolo
gies
given the large number of firms and the high dimensionality of mostly qualitative ex
planatory variables in our dataset we introduce highdimensional logit models estimated via
a lassopenalized maximum likelihood estimator with survey weights to ensure representa
tiveness of canadian firms we use a debiasing method for inference on the selected models
coefficients and establish its asymptotic validity to assess how closely firms operate to their
technological usage frontier we apply stochastic frontier analysis additionally we employ k
means clustering to categorize firms by technological efficiency facilitating the identification
2
of distinct profiles of digital adoption and efficiency
the literature on digital technology adoption emphasizes its role in improving firm pro
ductivity larger firms are often better positioned to implement these technologies benefiting
from economies of scale and greater access to resources leung et al 2008 in contrast
smaller firms frequently encounter barriers including high costs of implementation and lim
ited technical expertise which can hinder their ability to fully realize the potential benefits
of digital adoption ferrari 2012 demonstrates that industryspecific differences in digital
readiness significantly affect adoption rates while aghimien et al 2021 highlight the role
of regional policies in either enabling or constricting firms technological advancement to
gether these studies emphasize the structural factors shaping disparities in digital technology
adoption across firms
in canada bilodeau et al 2019 using data from the 2017 cscsc show the widespread
reliance of canadian businesses on digital technologies they report that about 92 of cana
dian businesses used one or more digital technologies or services in 2017 with significant
increases in the adoption of websites and social media integration since 2013 in addition
just over onefifth of canadian businesses reported being impacted by cyber security incidents
that affected their operations with 54 noting that these incidents prevented employees from
carrying out daytoday work and about 30 experiencing additional repair or recovery costs
while digital adoption can boost productivity it also introduces new risks particularly
related to cyber security the geneva association a leading international think tank of
the insurance industry defines cyber risks as breaches in confidentiality availability and
data integrity posing operational threats to firms that increasingly rely on interconnected
digital systems eling et al 2016 cebula and young 2010 expand on this definition
framing cyber risks as disruptions that extend beyond information technology it systems to
affect broader business stability in canada the toronto public library system experienced
significantdisruptionsfollowingacyberattack whilethenovascotiahealthdepartmentfaced
operational delays and data breaches during a similar event bridge and zoledziowski 2024
bousquet 2023
the adoption of advanced technologies such as internet of things iot and enterprise
management systems could increase cyber security risks blichfeldt and faullant 2021 high
light that while these systems can improve productivity their complexity often introduces
integration challenges that if poorly managed can undermine business operations addition
ally the widespread use of interconnected devices has expanded the potential attack surface
for cybercriminals requiring firms to invest more heavily in cyber security infrastructure
3
remote work adoption during the covid19 pandemic accelerated the reliance on digital
tools but also introduced new risks and challenges hackney et al 2022 find that firms
effectively utilizing digital technologies during the pandemic demonstrated resilience in main
taining operations under lockdown conditions however aczel et al 2021 and kitagawa
et al 2021 report that the rapid shift to remote work led to heightened employee burnout
and increased risks of phishing attacks underscoring the broader implications of accelerated
digital adoption
cyber insurance is a tool for mitigating cyber security risks according to the oecd
oecd 2017 the cyber insurance market doubled in size between 2015 and 2020 fueled by
firms increasing awareness of cyber threats however fitch ratings fitch ratings 2021
highlights that high premiums and restrictive coverage policies hinder adoption especially
among smaller firms globally cyber security spending is projected to surpass 170 billion by
2026 gartner inc 2021
despite the growing demand for cyber insurance firms may strategically underinvest in
cyber security measures due to the unobservable nature of such investments ahnert et al
2022 argue that firms may prioritize visible innovations over less transparent risk mitigation
strategies as clients are often unable to directly evaluate cyber security expenditures this
dynamic creates a paradox in which firms recognize the increasing risks of digital adoption
but fail to allocate sufficient resources to mitigate them effectively
the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the datasets used in the study the
sdtiu and the cscsc as well as the construction of the associated scores and variables
section 3 outlines the papers main contribution and methodological framework the survey
weighted debiased logit lasso method section 4 presents the empirical results discussing the
key determinants of technological efficiency and cyber security vulnerabilities we conclude
in section 5 with a discussion of the implications of our findings for canadian businesses
and policymakers the appendix is divided into two parts appendix a provides additional
technical details on the surveyweighted debiased logit lasso model and appendix b outlines
the questions that comprise the bdus and the cyber security incidence indicator
2 data description and variable construction
the empirical analysis is based on a merged dataset from two statistics canada surveys the
2021 sdtiu and the 2021 cscsc these surveys were merged using firm size and industry
4
classifications from the north american industry classification system naics enabling an
integrated study of digital adoption and cyber security risks among canadian businesses1
the sdtiu focuses on digital technology adoption including metrics such as internet
usage ecommerceparticipation andictadoption whilethecscscexaminescybersecurity
practices and the impact of cyber incidents on businesses the merged dataset includes both
qualitative variables such as the implementation of specific technologies and cyber security
measures and quantitative variables such as cyber security expenditure and incidentrelated
costs together the surveys cover numerous variables relevant to digital adoption and cyber
security the firms vary in size ranging from small enterprises with fewer than 10 employees
to large corporations with over 500 employees the industries covered include manufacturing
retail professional services and information technology
both surveys apply stratified sampling by industry and firm size with survey weights
correctingforselectionprobabilitiesnonresponsesandsamplingbiases theseweightsensure
that the results are representative of the broader population of canadian enterprises the
sdtiu achieved a response rate of 73 while the cscsc had a response rate of 65 the
prematched weighted samples cover 327567 enterprises for the sdtiu and 185644 for the
cscsc after merging the final dataset comprises a weighted sample of 179657 enterprises
ensuring comprehensive coverage across various business demographics
below we introduce aggregate measures of digital technology usage bdus in section
21 a separate measure of business technological efficiency based on kmeans clustering in
section 22 which examines whether firms encounter significant challenges in implementing
the technologies they adopt and an indicator for cyber security incidence in section 23
21 business digital usage score
the bdus is a quantitative variable constructed to evaluate the digital engagement of cana
dian firms by measuring the technologies they have adopted it condenses responses from the
2021 sdtiu into a single interpretable score that reflects the cumulative utilization of digital
tools across ten distinct domains such as cloud computing digital payment systems artifi
cial intelligence ai smart devices online sales government digital connectivity fiberoptic
internet and company websites see appendix b for the exact questions
1methodological differences between the surveys include variations in enterprise size definitions for small
firms sdtiudefinessmallfirmsasthosewith549employees whilecscscdefinesthemas1049employees
and potential differences in primary respondents understanding of their enterprises operations additionally
the surveys differ in target populations including naics and enterprise size requirements
5
for each of the ten domains we create a binary variable equal to 1 if the firm reports using
that technology summing these indicators yields a score between 0 and 10 with higher values
indicating more extensive digital engagement although it is conceivable that advanced tech
nologies eg ai have disproportionate impacts on firm productivity compared to simpler
ones eg a basic website weighting them by perceived importance would introduce addi
tional assumptions firms also have heterogeneous technological needs some rely heavily on
cloud computing for scalable data storage while others benefit more from online payment sys
tems or data analytics therefore uniform summation provides a transparent easily replicable
index of a firms overall digital footprint

figure 1 histogram of business digital usage scores
figure 1 shows the distribution of bdus scores the majority of firms fall within scores
of 3 to 7 suggesting moderate overall adoption levels with mild peaks at 4 and 6 at the
extremes a small proportion of firms report virtually no digital engagement score  0
whereas another small subset achieves nearcomprehensive adoption scores of 9 or 10 this
dispersion highlights the heterogeneity of adoption patterns some businesses implement only
a handful of relevant technologies while others adopt a wide array
it is important to note that the bdus does not measure the intensity of usage or the ease
of integration rather it provides a concise snapshot of whether certain wellknown tools have
been adopted in at least a basic form we use the bdus to investigate the characteristics
of firms that adopt digital technologies through a stochastic frontier model in section 4
measuring how close businesses are to their technological frontier additionally we use the
bdus to assess whether having a more extensive digital profile correlates with cyber risk
exposure table 1
6
22 business technological efficiency
while the bdus captures which digital technologies firms adopt it does not gauge how well
these technologies are integrated to address this we construct a measure of technological
efficiency by applying a kmeans clustering algorithm to a set of sdtiu survey items about
technological implementation challenges specifically these survey items parallel the bdus
domains but ask whether the firm experiences difficulties using each technology whereas the
bdus questions simply ask if firms use each technology the exact questions used in this
clustering exercise are listed in appendix b
letzi1zi2zi10be binary indicators for firm i capturing whether it reports a chal
lenge in each of the ten domains a response of yes indicates an operational problem in
using the technology associated with that domain we apply kmeans clustering to these
ten binary variables and determine that k 2is the optimal cluster count resulting in two
groupsdigitally efficient andnot digitally efficient  figure 2 displays the percentage of
reported challenges in each domain for these two clusters firms in the latter cluster 52505
businesses report significantly more issues than those in the former 127152 businesses for
example 7071 of not digitally efficient firms cite difficulties with ai compared to 2358
in thedigitally efficient group similarly 5755 of not digitally efficient firms encounter
challenges with cloud computing versus only 321 among digitally efficient firms
the high incidence of challenges among not digitally efficient firms does not imply that
they fail to adopt these tools some businesses report both a high bdus score indicating
widespread adoption and frequent operational issues suggesting partial or suboptimal imple
mentation even in the digitally efficient cluster a nontrivial share of firms faces difficulties
in at least one domain
thiskmeans classification yields a binary variable technological efficiency which we use
as a dependent variable in one of the logit models in section 4 whereas the bdus measures
the extent of adoption the technological efficiency grouping reflects the firms ability to use
the technology effectively in this sense the two measures are complementary the bdus
indicates how many digital tools a firm adopts while the logit model using the technological
efficiency variable reveals whether the adopted technologies are being used efficiently
23 cyber security incidence
to examine the cyber security challenges faced by canadian businesses we construct a set of

primary variable cyber security incidence  indicates whether a business was affected by any
cyber security incident in 2021 this binary variable is coded as 1 if the business reported
experiencing one or more types of cyber security incidents and 0 otherwise these incidents
range from theft of assets business data or intellectual property to disruptions of business
activities of the 179656 surveyed firms 39524 22 reported at least one such incident
while the remaining 140132 78 reported none
figure 3 shows the occurrence of these incident types among the 39524 firms that experi
enced any cyber incident the most frequently cited issues included incidents to steal money
or demand ransom payment 37 incidents with an unknown motive 39 incidents to
steal personal or financial information 33 incidents to disrupt or deface the business or
web presence 18 and incidents to access unauthorised or privileged areas 20 fewer
respondents reported incidents to steal or manipulate intellectual property or business data
98 and incidents to monitor and track business activity 92
we use this binary cyber security incidence variable in subsequent analyses for two pri
mary reasons it serves as a dependent variable in the cyber security incidence logit model
section 4 where we identify which firm characteristics and digital adoption practices predict
a higher likelihood of experiencing an incident the cyber security incidence variable is also

3 estimation methodology survey weighted debiased
lasso
to estimate models predicting technological efficiency and cyber security incidents we employ
a surveyweighted logistic lasso hereafter svy llasso  estimation technique and introduce
a debiasing method for inference this approach is wellsuited to our analysis as it effectively
handles highdimensional data and incorporates a diverse set of variables including digital
technologyusage cybersecuritypractices andfirmcharacteristics ourprimarylassomodels
include over 50 independent variables while secondorder interaction models expand to more
than 200 variables
to accurately represent the population of canadian businesses we adapt the standard
logistic lasso method to incorporate statistics canada survey weights to this end we define
9
the following general 1penalized maximum likelihood estimator for a generalized linear

unlike van de geer et al 2014 no direct assumption is imposed on the sparsity of the inverse

using this proposition we make inference on the parameters 0and0 in sum the

survey data ensuring both variable selection and valid inference in the presence of survey
weights

4 empirical results
the empirical analysis examines the relationship between digital technology adoption and
cyber security vulnerabilities among canadian businesses we begin by assessing whether
broader digital adoption correlates with increased cyber risk section 41 using rank corre
lations between the bdus and various security measures next we estimate a stochastic
frontier analysis sfa model section 42 treating the bdus as an output to identify
which factors drive a firm toward its digital usage frontier we then employ logit models with
lasso selection for two binary outcomes technological efficiency section 43 and cyber
security incidence section 44 allowing us to determine whether the same firm characteris
tics or digital practices that foster greater adoption also enhance implementation efficiency or
increase cyber vulnerability
the sample sizes for the analyses are as follows the svy llasso results for business ef
ficiency are based on a weighted sample of 175428 businesses excluding those with a bdus
score less than 2 the cyber security incidence model uses the full merged dataset encompass
ing 179657 businesses the svy llasso procedure is implemented using r where we utilize
the default value of the tuning parameter from the rpackage glmnetsee appendix a1
41 digital technology adoption and cyber security
we explore whether a broader digital presence for a firm correlates with heightened cyber risk
table 1 reports polychoric and polyserial correlations between the bdus an ordinal score
from 0 to 10 that measures the amount of technology a firm has adopted and various cyber
security measures including firms cyber security spending continuous variable a binary
indicator for whether or not a firm experienced a cyber incident and whether or not a firm
paid ransom as a result of a cyber security breach we use polychoric correlation for ordinal
to binary comparisons and polyserial correlation for the ordinal to continuous comparison
the positive and significant correlation between bdus and both cyber security spending
 0156 and experiencing an incident   0083 suggests that while digitally en
gaged firms invest more in security they also face greater exposure to attacks firms with
a higher bdus are also more likely to have to pay a ransom as a result of a cyber security
breach  0266 the absence of any cyber security measures correlates negatively with
bdus 0068 indicating that firms with minimal digital footprints may perceive
fewer threats but also forgo basic protective actions

for the ordinal bdus and the continuous measure of cyber security spending all correlations are statistically

these correlations provide preliminary evidence of a tradeoff as firms adopt more digital
tools higher bdus they may both allocate more resources to cyber security and become
more frequent targets of attacks this finding motivates the proceeding empirical analyses
42 digital technology adoption by canadian businesses
we estimate an sfa model to examine which firmlevel and industrylevel characteristics
bring businesses closer to their digital usage frontier treating bdus a quantitative score
010 as an output  that is the extent to which a firm adopts digital tools  allows us
to separate random variation from systematic shortfalls in adoption the frontier approach
is particularly useful because some firms may lag in adopting new technologies for reasons
beyond mere chance eg internal constraints or strategic decisions in this specification a
positive coefficient indicates that the corresponding variable moves firms closer to the frontier
of digital adoption
table 2 presents the maximum likelihood estimates for the logistic sfa model we use
a logistic specification to account for the bounded nature of bdus recognizing that moving
from for example two to three adopted technologies represents a more substantial increase
in digital capacity than moving from eight to nine the explanatory variables are grouped
into three categories firm characteristics digital technologies  andcyber security measures 
after controlling for industry fixed effects the estimated mean efficiency score across all firms
is 77 suggesting that while most businesses integrate some digital tools gaps remain

of digital adoption but does not capture how effectively these tools are utilized to address
this distinction we introduce a binary variable for technological efficiency  derived through
kmeans clustering this clustering algorithm categorizes firms based on whether they report
few or many operational difficulties in using adopted technologies a firm is classified as
technologically efficient if it experiences relatively few challenges across multiple domains
see section 2 for details we restrict the sample to businesses with bdus 2 ensuring a
baseline level of digital engagement prior to evaluating efficiency
table 3 presents the svy llasso results for the probability of a firm being technologically
efficient the independent variables are grouped into three categories firm characteristics 
digital technologies  andcyber security measures  a positive coefficient indicates that the

44 cyber security incidence
the determinants of cyber security incidence variable are analyzed using a binary dependent
variable introduced in section 2 the cyber security incidence variable equals 1 if a firm
reported experiencing at least one cyber security incident during 2021 and 0 otherwise among
179656 surveyed firms 32371 180 reported an incident cyber incidents encompass
a range of adverse events including theft of business assets data breaches disruptions to
business activities intellectual property losses and other cyberrelated issues although a
large number of independent variables are included in the analysis relatively few emerge as
statistically significant predictors indicating that cyber risk is shaped by a limited subset of
factors

table 4 displays the svy llasso estimates for the probability of experiencing a cyber

tions are being a large firm  amedb 0057 and adopting confidential cloud solutions
amedb 0067 in addition certain industry categories miningutilitiesconstruction

cant positive coefficients
two factors show negative and statistically significant effects on the likelihood of a cyber
incident having over 60 female employees in cyber security roles  amedb0056
and holding cyber security insurance  amedb0043 are both associated with lower
probabilities of experiencing an incident
these results suggest that larger enterprises may face heightened cyber risks potentially
reflecting the extensive data infrastructures and more valuable assets characteristic of bigger
firms reliance on confidential cloud solutions might increase exposure to attacks as remote
and cloudbased systems use electronic methods to store data lower incidence rates among
firms with higher proportions of female cyber security personnel could indicate that diverse
cyber teams are more adept at preventing or responding to threats likewise the negative
association of cyber security insurance with incidence likelihood hints that insured firms may
adopt more robust preventive strategies to manage their risk profiles
45 interaction effects
usinganadaptivelassoapproachwithpolynomialexpansions weinvestigatewhethersecond
order interaction terms enhance the predictive accuracy of our technological efficiency and
cyber security incidence specifications we estimate both a firstorder linear model and a
secondorder model that includes all pairwise interactions among the explanatory variables
see bhlmann and van de geer 2011 for the theoretical background
table 5 reports meansquared crossvalidation cv errors under each specification along
with the penalty parameter cv for the technological efficiency model allowing second
order terms substantially lowers the cv error suggesting that interactions play an important
role in explaining efficiency gains from digital technologies in the cyber security incidence
model the simpler firstorder specification yields a slightly lower cv error indicating that
20
higherorder interactions do not improve predictions of cyber security incidence likelihood
a secondorder polynomial specification is justified for the technological efficiency model
therefore we reestimate the svy llasso model with interaction terms involving firm size
remote work key technologies and industry classifications table 6 shows the significant
interaction terms selected by the svy llasso estimator along with their debiased parameter
estimates dbandpvalues only the interaction coefficients that were selected by the lasso

5 conclusion
this paper contributes new evidence on how canadian businesses navigate the tradeoff be
tween digital technology adoption and heightened cyber security risk using data from statis
tics canadas sdtiu and cscsc surveys we construct a bdus to gauge overall adoption
levels and then evaluate how effectively businesses use these tools by modeling their technolog
ical efficiency in addition we employ a surveyweightadjusted lasso estimator and introduce
a debiasing method for highdimensional logit models to identify the drivers of technological
efficiency and cybersecurity risk
the stochastic frontier analysis suggests that larger firms remote work arrangements and
specific advanced technologies eg opensource solutions client information management
systems can push a firm closer to its digital frontier at the same time a portion of
businesses lag behind feasible adoption levels as indicated by the high ratio of inefficiency to
noise in the frontier estimations
firmsmustbalanceefficiencygainsagainstgrowingcybervulnerabilities firmsthatadopt
more sophisticated digital technologies or store sensitive data in the cloud often face elevated
risk exposure our svy llasso model on cyber incidence confirm that large firms and those
using cloudbased services are more likely to report cyber security incidents however the pre
dictive power of cyber risk does not improve with secondorder interaction effects suggesting
that firm size and core technological choices are the primary drivers of cyber exposure the
two main variables that decreased the likelihood of cyber incidents were firms having cyber
security insurance and firms that had a high representation of females in cyber security roles
when it comes to technological efficiency simple linear relationships fail to capture the
complexity of how organizational choices workforce composition and industry shape digital
outcomes by allowing secondorder interaction terms the svy llasso approach shows that
certain combinations of variables such as medium firms adopting iot or female ict repre
sentation interacting with advanced tools like ai can be particularly conducive to efficiency
improvements on the other hand friction in implementing complex software like edi or
erp can negate some of these benefits
the analysis demonstrates the importance of firm size and industry while small firms
are sometimes more locally efficient the resource advantages of larger organizations may
facilitate deeper or more comprehensive integration of technologies industries also differ sub
stantially in resource and assetintensive sectors such as mining or construction strong
positive interactions emerge between targeted digital solutions and improved operational pro
24
cesses whereas complianceheavy fields like education and health exhibit more negative or
complex relationships
gender composition in ict roles has meaningful consequences for digital adoption out
comes although our results do not prove a causal mechanism the recurring positive coeffi
cients on interactions involving a share of female ict staff and advanced technologies suggest
that even partial gender diversity in technical teams can amplify the returns to adopting new
tools this pattern is also seen in broader research suggesting that heterogeneity in skill sets
and perspectives can catalyze creative problemsolving
the results highlight the balance firms must strike between achieving efficiency gains from
digital technologies and managing increased cyber risks larger digitally advanced firms ap
proach their efficiency frontier yet face elevated cyber vulnerability especially when security
practices fall short remote work arrangements enhance both digital adoption and techno
logical efficiency without increasing cyber risk exposure female representation in ict and
cyber security roles consistently improves outcomes across adoption efficiency and cyber se
curity certain cyber security practices particularly obtaining cyber security insurance and
ensuring gender diversity within cyber security roles significantly reduce incident likelihood
reliance on cloudbased services notably confidential cloud storage emerges as a risk factor
increasing cyber vulnerability these results suggest policymakers should implement targeted
digital strategies tailored by industry and firm size to boost technological efficiency while
simultaneously establishing baseline cyber security practices such as insurance coverage and
workforce diversity to mitigate cyber threats effectively

b survey questions used for variable construction
this appendix provides the survey questions used to construct the cyber score the kmeans
clustering variables and the business digital usage score bdus each set of questions
corresponds to specific aspects of digital technology adoption and cyber security challenges
b1 cyber security incidence variable construction
the cyber security incidence variable is equal to 1 if a firm answers yes to one of the
following questions and 0 otherwise
to the best of your knowledge which cyber security incidents impacted your busi
ness in 2021 select all that apply
incidents to disrupt or deface the business or web presence
incidents to steal personal or financial information
incidents to steal money or demand ransom payment
incidents to steal or manipulate intellectual property or business data
incidents to access unauthorised or privileged areas
incidents to monitor and track business activity
incidents with an unknown motive
b2 questions used for kmeans clustering
