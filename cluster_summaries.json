C. Remy, Houhuai Xu\n\n**Methodology:** The authors propose an innovative framework to specify cyber range requirements, characterize cyber range architectures, and match cyber range architectures to cyber range requirements. They analyze 45 real-world cyber range architectures and develop an algorithm to match architectures to organizations' needs.\n\n**Findings:**\n\n1. The authors identify three research questions to guide the design of cyber ranges: how to specify cyber range requirements, how to characterize cyber range architectures, and how to map available cyber range architectures to given cyber range requirements.\n2. They propose a conceptual framework with three components: characterizing cyber range requirements, characterizing cyber range architectures, and designing an algorithm to match cyber range architectures to cyber range requirements.\n3. The authors analyze 45 real-world cyber range architectures and identify six cyber range architectures that can be abstracted from these architectures.\n4. They develop an algorithm to match cyber range architectures to organizations' needs, taking into account 22 attributes to specify cyber range requirements.\n\n**Trends:**\n\n1. The increasing demand for cyber ranges in various industry sectors, driven by the need for cybersecurity training, testing of cyberphysical systems, and cybersecurity research.\n2. The lack of scientific rigor in the design of current cyber ranges, which are often based on heuristics or experience.\n3. The importance of treating cyber ranges as a new kind of cybersecurity instrument, requiring scientific rigor in their design and development.\n4. The need for organizations to choose the most appropriate cyber ranges according to their requirements, customize their own cyber ranges, and provide insights into future cyber range design and development.\n\n**Implications:**\n\n1. The proposed framework can help organizations specify their cyber range requirements, characterize cyber range architectures, and match architectures to their needs.\n2. The analysis of 45 real-world cyber range architectures can provide insights into the commonalities and differences between various cyber range architectures.\n3. The algorithm developed by the authors can help automate the process of matching cyber range architectures to organizations' needs, reducing the complexity and increasing the efficiency of cyber range design and development.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. The study is limited to the analysis of 45 real-world cyber range architectures, which may not be representative of all cyber range architectures.\n2. The framework proposed by the authors may require further refinement and validation to ensure its effectiveness in practice.\n3.

They also reviewed existing literature on cyber security incident management and crisis management to identify gaps in research.\n\n**Findings:**\n\n1. The EU's new cyber security laws equate cyber security crises with large-scale cyber security incidents that exceed the handling capacity of a single member state or affect at least two member states.\n2. The laws substantially increase mandatory reporting about cyber security incidents, including large-scale incidents.\n3. Despite the laws and new governance bodies established by them, the working of actual cyber security crisis management remains unclear, particularly at the EU level.\n4. The paper contributes to the incident management research domain by elaborating on how incidents are related to and may transform into crises.\n\n**Trends:**\n\n1. The EU's focus on cyber security crisis management is a timely and relevant topic, with the European Commission recently releasing a new proposal for handling large-scale cross-country cyber security crises in Europe.\n2. The paper fills a gap in existing research by examining cyber security crisis management in the EU context, which has been missing from previous studies.\n3. The paper contributes to the recent efforts to digest and analyze the EU's many new cyber security laws and their implications.\n4. The research highlights the importance of understanding how the EU's new cyber security legal framework is designed with crisis management in mind.\n\n**Keywords:** Risk management, risk analysis, incident management, crisis management, regulations, governance, EU.\n\n**Implications:** The findings of this study have practical relevance and implications for policymakers, researchers, and organizations involved in cyber security incident management and crisis management. The study highlights the need for further research on cyber security crisis management in the EU context and the importance of understanding how incidents are related to and may transform into crises."
