The key properties ofthe transform aredeveloped.
Introduction
TheΞ-transform is a transform arising naturally in general rela tivity, which was
foundearlierthisyearbytheauthorastheculminationofal ongdevelopment[1]-
[12]. IfMisaspace-time(space andtimeorientable,withaﬁxed spins tructure),
denote by S∗the co-spin bundle of M, the space of all pairs (x,π), withx∈M
andπa Weyl co-spinor at x, soS∗is a complex vector bundle over M, whose
complex ﬁber dimension is two. For convenience, we delete th e zero section, so
π/ne}ationslash= 0. Denote by Nthe horizontal vector ﬁeld on S∗, that represents the null
geodesicspray. Atwistorfunction f(x,π)isbydeﬁnitionafunctionon S∗thatis
killedbyN[13]-[15]. Thefunction f(x,π)issaidtobehomogeneousofintegral
degreekif and only if f(x,tπ) =tkf(x,π), for any real non-zero t. Denote
byHkthe space of all twistor functions, homogeneous of degree k. Then the Ξ-
transform is a conformally invariant transform mapping H−4toH−2. The basic
deﬁnition of the transform is given in detail in the author’s preprint [1]. In this
work we analyze the transform for the case of conformally ﬂat space-time. We
discussthreeversionsofthetransform,heredenotedby Ξ1,Ξ2andΞ3:
•Ξ1(f)(g,h) =/integraldisplay
p∈Gf(p,g−1ph)ωp.
HereGis a compact Lie group, ωpis Haar measure, and fis a smooth

•Ξ2(f)(x,η) =i/integraldisplay
πA′ηA′=1f(xa+sηAηA′,πC′)dsπB′dπB′πBdπB.
Hereweusetwo-componentspinornotation[13]-[15]. Thefu nctionf(xa,πA′)
isatwistorfunction,soisconstantalongnullgeodesics: πA′πA∂af(xb,πB′) =
0and is homogeneous of degree minus four: f(x,tπ) =t−4, fortreal and
non-zero. Then the output function Ξ2(f)is also a twistor function, this
timehomogeneousofdegreeminustwo.
At ﬁrst sight, these two transformations may seem unrelated . We link them by
invoking a third transformation, which uses the triality th eory of Elie Cartan for
spinorsassociatedtothegroup O(4,4,R)[16]-[17],[12],[2]. Thisemploysthree
eight-dimensional real vector spaces, Vα,VβandVγ, each equipped with a dot
productofneutralsignature (4,4)andlinkedbythetrialitymap,denoted (xyz)∈
R,foranyx,yandzinVα,VβandVγ. Dualizing,weobtainproductmaps,such
that(xyz) = (yz).x= (zx).y= (xy).z, for any x,yandzinVα,VβandVγ,
wheretheproducts (yz),(zx)and(xy)takevaluesin Vα,VβandVγ,respectively.

The triality obeys the key relations: ((yz)y) =y.yz,(z(yz)) =z.zy,(x(zx)) =
x.xz,((zx)z) =z.zx,(y(xy)) =y.yxand((xy)x) =x.xy, for anyx,yandzin
Vα,VβandVγand the whole theory is invariant under permutations of the t hree
vector spaces. Such a triality is usually studied in the posi tive deﬁnite case, in
whichcase, if (xy) = 0,forxinVαandyinVβ, thenitfollowsimmediatelythat
eitherxoryis zero. Here however, if (xy) = 0, we have 0 = ((xy)x) =x.xy
and0 = (y(xy)) =y.yx, from which we see that it is conceivable that xandy
can be both non-zero, provided that they are both null vector s. Then for ya ﬁxed
non-zero null vector in Vβ, it emerges that the space Nyof solutions x∈Vα, of
theequation (xy) = 0isafour-dimensionalcompletelynullself-dualsubspaceo f

Herefis a smooth function, homogeneous of degree minus four in the

resenting the fundamental homology class of the complement of the origin
inthefour-space Ny. It emerges that ξ3(f)(y)abcdfactorizes:
•ξ3(f)(y)abcd= Ξ3(f)(y)σabcd(y).
Hereσabcd=σabcd
e′f′ye′yf′andσabcd
e′f′=σ[abcd]
(e′f′)andσabcd
e′f′is trace-free in its

e′f′gives a natural isomorphism of the space of
trace-free symmetric tensors of Vβwith the space of self-dual four skew
four-index tensors of the space Vα, both spaces being thirty-ﬁve dimen-
sional. Thenthecoefﬁcient Ξ3(f)(y)issmoothandhomogeneousofdegree

•All three transforms obey an equation of the form Ξ◦/square=/square◦Ξ = 0,
where/squareis a second-order conformally invariant wave operator (for the
ultra-hyperbolicsignature (3,3)),whoseexistencefollowsfromthegeneral
theory of C. Robin Graham, Ralph Jenne, Lionel Mason and the p resent
author[18].
We suspect that a stronger result is true: namely that the ker nels and images of
Ξand/squareexactly match. Howeverwe only provethis here under the tech nical as-

•In section ﬁve, we introduce the transform and prove its basi c properties,
for the case of an arbitrary compact Lie group. In particular for the case
when the group is SU(2,C), we prove the relation C ◦Ξ = Ξ◦ C= 0,
whereC=C+−C−andC+andC−are the standard quadratic Casimir
differential operators of SU(2,C), deﬁned in terms of the ﬁrst and second

•Finally in section twenty, we reduce the invariant transfor m to the two-

equivalent. In particular the group structure of the ﬁrst tr ansform is under-
stood to arise from a particular choice of conformal factor f or the invariant
approach. Thus in thegroup approach theunderlyingconform al invariance
is not manifest and the relevant functions are not conformal ly weighted,
unlikeintheothertwo cases.

1 Leftandrightinvariantvectorﬁelds
LetGbe a compact real Lie group, so Gis also naturally a smooth (even real
analytic) compact manifold. For each g∈Gdenote by Lg:G→GandRg:
G→Gthe smooth operations of left multiplication and right mult iplication,
respectively. So Lg(k) =gkandRgk=kg, for any h∈G. Note that Lg
andRhcommute for any gandhinG. Also denote by Adg:G→Gthe
adjoint representation of Gon itself, so we have Adg=LgRg−1, for anyg∈G.
Denote by ωthe Haar measure for the Lie group, which we represent smooth ly
by a volume-form ωwith value ωgatg∈G. Thenωis invariant under the
operations of left multiplication and right multiplicatio n by elements of G, soω
is also invariant under the adjoint map. Denote by ∇αthe Lie algebra of left-
invariant vector ﬁelds on G. Here we use Greek indices for the tensors based on
the tensor algebra of the tangent and cotangent spaces at the identity of G. Then
wehavetheLiebracket:
[∇α,∇β] =Cγ
αβ∇γ.
HereCγ
αβ=−Cγ
βαare the structure constants of the Lie algebra. Similarly,
denoteby ∆αtheLie algebra of right-invariantvectorﬁelds on G. Then we have
theLiebrackets:
[∇α,∆β] = 0,[∆α,∆β] =−Cγ
αβ∆γ.
Here we have the normalization that at the identity of G,∆αand∇αare equal
(and are equal to the Kronecker delta tensorat that point). D enote by Ad (g)β

Thenwehave:

the corresponding left-invariant vectorﬁeld. Integratin g the vector ﬁeld ∇vgives
a one-parameter group of transformations of G, denoted by Rv(t), witht∈R.
We have Rv(t) =Rgv(t), whereexpv(t)is the integral curve passing through
the identity element of the vector ﬁeld ∇v. Also denote by ∆v=vα∆αthe
corresponding right-invariant vector ﬁeld. Integrating t he vector ﬁeld ∆vgives a
one-parametergroupoftransformationsof G,denotedby Lv(t),witht∈R. Then
wehaveLv(t) =Lexpv(t). Notethat expv(−t) = (expv(t))−1,foranyvin theLie

2 Casimiroperators
ACasimiroperator CfortheLiegroup Gis,bydeﬁnition,adifferentialoperator
onG, that is both left and right-invariant. Such an operator may be written as a
polynomialintheoperators ∇αor∆αwithconstantcoefﬁcients. ModulotheLie
algebra relations, it then has a unique expression as a sum co mbination of terms
Cn,n= 0,1,2,..., whereC0is a constant multipleof the identity and if n≥1,
Cntakes thefollowingform:
Cn=Cα1α2...αn∇α1∇α2...∇αn=Cα1α2...αn∆α1∆α2...∆αn.
Herethecoefﬁcienttensor Cα1α2...αnistotallysymmetricandisbothleft-invariant
and right-invariant. If Cn= 0for all odd n, we say that the Casimir operator is
even; ifCn= 0, for all even n, we say that the Casimir operator is odd. If only
Ckis non-zero,wesay that theCasimiroperatoris oforder k.
In the special case that the Lie group is semi-simple, we intr oduce the Killing
form,deﬁned by theformula:
gαβ=Cδ
αγCγ
βδ.
Thenitisstandardthat gαβissymmetricandinvertibleandleftandrightinvariant.
Denoting its inverse by gαβ, we have a preferred second order Casimir operator,
denotedby /square:
/square=gαβ∇α∇β=gαβ∆α∆β.
In general, if the Lie group has rank m, there are mindependent Casimir oper-
ators, that together with the identity operator generate th e algebra of all Casimir
operators. Forexampleinthecaseofthespecialunitarygro upSU(n,C),consist-
ing of all unitary n×ncomplex matrices of unit determinant, we may write the
Liealgebra as:
[Eα

δ] =δγ
βEα
δ−δα
δEδ

HereEα

3 ThecaseoftheLiegroup SU(2,C);harmonics
Thecaseweneedforlateristhecaseofthegroup SU(2,C),whichwewillusually
represent as the group of quaternions qthat are unit: qq=qq= 1. If we write
q=t+xi+yj+zk, where(t,x,y,z)∈R4,i2=j2=k2=ijk=−1,
then the group is represented as the unit real three-sphere i nR4, with equation
t2+x2+y2+z2= 1. A basis for the left invariant vector ﬁelds is obtained
fromtheoneparametergroups eis,ejsandeks,wheresisreal. Thecorresponding
left-invariantvectorﬁelds areas follows:
J=t∇−x∂t−x×∇.
Here we have x= [x,y,z]and∇= [∂x,∂y,∂z]and we use standard vector
notationforEuclidean three-spacewithco-ordinatevecto rx. Then wehave:
J×J= (t∇−x∂t−x×∇)×(t∇−x∂t−x×∇)
= (x×∇)t∂t+t(∇×(∇×x))−x∂t×(t∇)+x×(x×∇)∂t
−(x×∇)×(t∇−x∂t−x×∇)
=−x×∇+t∇(3+x.∇)−t(∇.∇)x−(x.x)∇∂t+x(x.∇)∂t
+x(∇.(t∇−x∂t))−∇(x.(t∇−x∂t))+t∇−x∂t−x×∇
= 2t∇−2x×∇−(x.x)∇∂t−4x∂t+∇(x.x)∂t= 2J.
Writtenoutin components,wehave:
[Ji,Jj] = 2ǫijkJk.
Hereǫijkis the alternating symbol on three elements, with ǫ123= 1. The right-
invariantvectorﬁelds areobtainedsimilarly:
K=t∇−x∂t+x×∇.
Notethatattheidentity,where t= 1andx= 0,thevectors JandKagree, since
theyeach reduce tojust ∇. Thenwehave:
[Ki,Kj] =−2ǫijkKk,[Ji,Kj] = 0.

There is one non-trivial Casimir operator, associated to th e Killing form, which
wemaytaketo be:
J.J= (t∇−x∂t−x×∇).(t∇−x∂t−x×∇)
=t2∇.∇−(3+x.∇)t∂t−x.∇(1+t∂t)+x.x∂2

t+∇.∇)−2(t∂t+x.∇)−(t∂t+x.∇)2
= (gabxaxb)gcd∂c∂d−xa∂a(xb∂b+2).
Herexa= (t,x,y,z)andgabis represented bytheidentitymatrix,so wehave:
gabxaxb=t2+x2+y2+z2=t2+x.x,

Notethat K.Kisthesameoperatoras J.J.
A harmonic polynomial of degree k,p(xa), onSU(2,C)is the restriction to the
three-sphere gabxaxb= 1of a polynomial in xathat is harmonic gab∂a∂bp= 0
and is homogeneous of non-negative integral degree k:xa∂ap=kp. So we see
that a harmonic polynomial is an eigen-state of J.Jof eigen-value −k(k+ 2).
The polynomial is then said to have spink
2. Finally by the Peter-Weyl theorem
a smooth function on the group may be uniquely decomposed int o its harmonic
components. Explicitly,theharmonictransformation H(f)off(x)is:
H(f)(y) =/integraldisplay
S3f(x)ωx
(x−y).(x−y), y.y < 1.
Here thedot product is thestandard Euclidean dot productof vectors in R4. Also

4 Thespinorapproachto SU(2,C)
We work with a complex two-dimensional vector space S, called the spin space.
Sis equipped with a quaternionic conjugation: a conjugate co mplex linear map
fromSto itself, whose square is the negative of the identity. If α∈S, then its
conjugate is denoted α. Ifα∈S, then{α,α}forms a basis for S, overC, if
and only if αis non-zero. We use upper case Latin indices for the tensor al gebra
overCofS. Then the conjugate of the spinor αAis the spinor αA. We give Sa
complex symplectic structure, denoted ǫABwhich is self-conjugate. If αAis any
non-zero spinor, we have 2α[AαB]=kǫAB, wherekis real and non-zero. It is
easily seen that the sign of kis independent of the choice of the spinor α. We
say thatǫABis positively oriented, relative to the given conjugation, if and only
ifkis always positive. Note that if ǫABis not positively oriented, then −ǫABis
positively oriented. Henceforth we take ǫABto be positively oriented. Then αis
said to be normalized if and only if k= 1. In index-free notation, ǫis positively
orientedifandonlyifthereexistsanon-zerospinor α,suchthat 2α∧α=ǫ. Then
any such spinor αis normalized. If αis normalized and βis any spinor, then we
haveβ=pα+qα,forsomecomplexnumbers pandq. Thenβ=−qα+pαand
β∧β= (|p|2+|q|2)α∧α,soβisitselfnormalizedifandonlyif |p|2+|q|2= 1.
Thematrix mofthetransformation α→βis:
m=p−q
qp,det(m) =|p|2+|q|2= 1.
The group of all such transformations is the group SU(2,C). Using indices, the
elements of SU(2,C)are represented by endomorphisms mB
Awhich are self-
conjugateandpreserve ǫAB:

Spinorindicesareraisedandloweredusing ǫABanditsinverse ǫAB,asappropriate
according to the rules vA=vBǫBAandvA=ǫABvB. In particular, we have
ǫABǫAB= 2. Alsoa spinor αAis normalizedifand onlyif αAαA= 1.

It is clear that Ξ(f)is a smooth function on G×G. We calculate the operators

Then we have, for Ca Casimir operator of order k, after iteration of this

In this section, we make the simplifying assumption that all functions involved
arelinearcombinationsofonlyﬁnitelymanysphericalharm onics. Weexpect the
resultstogo throughwithoutthisassumption,butwedonot p rovethishere.
Henceforth we assume that G=SU(2,C), which is also the Lie group of unit
quaternions under multiplication. Denote by Cits second-order Casimir oper-
ator, determined by the negative of the inverse of its Killin g form, so that its
eigen-values are n(n+ 2), forna non-negative integer. For non-negative inte-
gerskandl, denote by Hk,lthe space of all (necessarily real analytic) harmonics
f(g,h)onSU(2,C)×SU(2,C)that obey the relations C+f=k(k+ 2)fand
C−f=l(l+2)f. Alsofor Nanynon-negativeinteger,put:

Henceforth we ﬁx Nand assume f∈HN. Suppose that the Ξ-transform of f
vanishes,sowehave Ξ(f)(g,h) =/integraltext
f(p,g−1ph)ωp= 0. Theharmonicparts fk,l

ofC=C+−C−, sinceCfk,l= (k−l)(k+l+2)fk,l, or equivalently,since the
eigen-valuefunction x(x+2)ofCis one-to-one for xreal and non-negative. So
theΞ-transform kills the space H−

thekernelof Ξactingon HN. Accordingly,weneedonlylookatfunctions f(g,h)

Finally, we notice that in the course of this proof, we have fo und that the image
ofΞacting on HNdoes not involve harmonics apart from those of the form fk,k
for0≤k≤N. This follows from the relation C+=C−=−2JcdJcd, acting

So acting on HN, theΞ-transform annihilates H−
Nand has zero kernel acting on
H+
N. But we have just shown that the image of each Hk,kunderΞlies inHk,k.
Since the kernel is zero and each Hk,kis ﬁnite dimensional, the restriction of Ξ
to eachHk,kis an isomorphism with its image. So the kernel of Ξacting on HN
is precisely thespace H−
Nand the imageof Ξacting on HNis precisely thespace
H+
N. The latter space is also the kernel of the operator C=C+−C−acting on
HN. We haveproved,foranynon-negativeinteger N:
•The kernel of Cacting on the space HNis the image of Ξ, acting on the
samespace.
•The kernel of Ξacting on the space HNis the image of C, acting on the

7 Thenulltwistorgeometry
The twistor space for conformally ﬂat space-time may be take n to be a four di-
mensionalcomplexvectorspace T, whoseelements are called twistors[13]-[15].
Complexiﬁed,conformallycompactiﬁedspace-timeisrecov eredas theGrassma-
nianGr(2,T)ofalltwo-dimensionalcomplexsubspacesof T,withtheconformal
structure such that xandyin Gr(2,T)are null related if and only if they have a
non-zero twistor in common. The space Tis equipped with a pseudo-hermitian
structureofsignature (2,2). IfZαdenotesatwistor,thenitsconjugateisdenoted
Zα, which lies in the complex dual space T∗ofT. Then the (real ) inner prod-
uct ofZαwith itself is ZαZα. The space Tis the disjoint union of three sets,
T±={Zα∈T:±ZαZα>0}andN={Zα∈T:ZαZα= 0}. The twistors
ofNare called null. Put N′=N− {0}. ThenN′is a smooth real manifold of
dimension seven. We say that x∈Gr(2,T)is real if and only if x⊂N. The key
factrelatingtwistortheorytospace-timeisthatthesubse tXofallrealelementsof
Gr(2,T)is a smooth four-manifold, equipped with the induced natura l structure
conformal structure, which makes Xa conformal compactiﬁcation of Minkowksi
space-time. Each element ZinN′belongs toa one-parameterfamily γ(Z)(acir-
cle) of elements of X, which forms a null geodesic in Xand every null geodesic
arises inthisway. Also γ(Z) =γ(Z′)ifand onlyif Z′=λZ, for0/ne}ationslash=λ∈C.
The twistor space Tcarries a natural ﬂat pseudo-K¨ ahler metric g=dZαdZα,
whose signature is (4,4). Restricting to the space N′, this metric degenerates,
with the direction of degeneracy given by the homogeneity ve ctor ﬁeld H=
Zα∂α+Zα∂α, where∂α=∂
∂Zαand∂α=∂
∂Zα. The one parameter group for
this vector ﬁeld is the transformation Zα→etZαwithtreal. Quotienting N′
out by this vectorﬁeld, we get a smooth six-manifold,denote dM, witha confor-
mallyﬂatconformalstructureofsignature (3,3),naturallyinducedbythepseudo-
K¨ ahler structure of T. We may assign co-ordinates Z= (α,β,γ,δ)∈C4forT,
suchthat:
ZαZα=|α|2+|β|2−|γ|2−|δ|2.
Then the twistors of N′satisfy|α|2+|β|2=|γ|2+|δ|2>0. When we quotient
by the scaling Z→etZ, we may take |α|2+|β|2=|γ|2+|δ|2= 1, soMis the
productS3×S3, whereS3is the real three-sphere. Further the induced metric is
the metric |dα|2+|dβ|2−|dγ|2−|dδ|2which gives Mthe metric G+−G−(of
signature (3,3)), where the G±are unit three-sphere metrics, applied to the ﬁrst
andsecondfactorsoftheproduct S3×S3inthecasesof G+andG−,respectively.

8 ThetwistorsymmetryLie groupsandalgebras
Thesymmetrygroup O(T)ofT,equippedwithitspseudo-K¨ ahlerstructure,isthe
group of real linear transformations of Tto itself preserving the pseudo-K¨ ahler
metric. Then O(T)is isomorphic to the twenty-eight dimensional real Lie grou p
O(4,4,R). The subgroup U(T)ofO(T)is the subgroup that preserves the com-
plex structure. It has sixteen real dimensions and is isomor phic to the Lie group
U(2,2,C). The Lie algebra o(T)ofO(T)is represented on the twistor space by
theoperators:
Eαβ= 2Z[α∂β],Eαβ= 2Z[α∂β], Eα
β=Zα∂β−Zβ∂α.
The operators EαβandEαβhave six complex degrees of freedom, counting for
twelve real dimensions. The operator Eα
βobeysEα
β=−Eα
β, so has sixteen de-
greesoffreedom. TheLiealgebracommutatorsareeasilycom puteddirectly,with

[Eαβ,Eγδ] = 0,[Eαβ,Eγδ] = 0,

Note that the operator Eα
βgenerates the Lie algebra u(T)ofU(T). The operator
H=Zα∂α+Zα∂αcommuteswiththewholealgebraof o(T). Alsointroducethe
(pureimaginary)operator E:
E=Eα
α=Zα∂α−Zα∂α.
TheniE, generates phase transformations of the twistor space: eitEmapsZαto
eitZα, foranyreal t. Notethat Egrades thealgebra o(T):
[E,Eαβ] = 2Eαβ,[E,Eα
β] = 0,[E,Eαβ] =−2Eαβ.
Alsoputh=Zα∂αandh=Zα∂α. Then wehave:
H=h+h, E=h−h,
h=1
2(H+E),h=1
2(H−E).
Note that all four operators h,h,EandHmutually commute. Finally note that
operatorsof o(T)killthefunction ZαZαsonaturallyinduceoperatorson N′. Also
theoperator Hpreserves ZαZαup toascale, so ittooinducesan operatoron N′.

9 Thenulltwistorwaveoperator /square
We consider the Laplacian operator associated to the pseudo -K¨ ahler structure of
T, theoperator /square=∂α∂α. We computethefollowingcommutator:
[/square,ZβZβ] = [∂α∂α,ZβZβ] =∂α[∂α,ZβZβ]+[∂α,ZβZβ]∂α
=∂αZα+Zα∂α= 4+Zα∂α+Zα∂α=H+4.
Then, by induction, it easily follows that for each positive integern, we have the
relation:
/squarenZβZβ=ZβZβ/squaren+n/squaren−1(H+5−n).
Nowletg(Z)beagivensmoothfunctionon N′. Extendg(Z)locallytoasmooth
function˜g(Z), deﬁned on an open set in Tcontaining the space N′. Then apply
theoperator /squarenandrestrict back to N′. Denotetheresultby /squaren(g). So wehave:
g→˜g→/squaren(˜g)|N′=/squaren(g).
Notethatthevectorﬁeld Histangentto N′,sogivesawell-deﬁnedsmoothvector
ﬁeld, still called HonN′. Forkan integer, denote by Hkthe space of smooth
functions f(Z)onN′, obeyingtherelation,forany Z∈N′and anyreal t/ne}ationslash= 0:
f(tZ) =tkf(Z).
We use the same notation Hk, for the associated sheaf and presheaf, the context
determining which interpretation is relevant. Suppose now thatg∈ Hk, sog
obeysHg=kg. Then we may consistently require that the extension ˜gobeys
the analogous relation H˜g=k˜g. Let˜g′be another such extension of g. Then we
haveH˜g′=k˜g′and˜g−˜g′vanisheson N′,sobytheMalgrangedivisiontheorem,
we may write ˜g−˜g′=ZαZαh(Z), where(H−k+ 2)h(Z) = 0. Then by our
calculationabove,wehave:
(/squaren(˜g−˜g′))(Z) =/squaren(ZαZαh(Z)) =ZαZα(/squaren(h))(Z)+n(/squaren−1(H+5−n)h)(Z)
=ZαZα(/squaren(h))(Z)+n(k−n+3)(/squaren−1h)(Z).
In the special case that k=n−3, the last term vanishes and restricting to N′we
get:/squaren(˜g)|N′=/squaren(˜g′)|N′. Hence we have /squaren(g)independent of the choice of
theextensionof gintoT, so/squaren(g)iscanonicallydeﬁned. Wehaveshown:
•Theoperator /squareninducesnaturallyamapfromthespace(orsheaf) Hn−3to

Only the case n= 1will be analyzed further here. The operator /squarethen induces

10 The null twistor wave operator constructed in-
trinsically in terms of the operators of the Lie

An alternative approach to the twistor wave operator uses th e operator Eαβ=
2Z[α∂β], which operates intrinsically to the space N′, since it kills the quantity
ZαZα. Wehavethefollowingrelations,usingthenotationofthep revioussection:

The left-hand side of this equation is intrinsic to N′, so therefore, so is the right-
hand side, acting on H−2. In the language of our conformal six manifold, M, the

11 Theco-spinbundleapproachtotwistorspace
In Minkowski space-time, we use complex two-component spin ors, with spinor
indexpairs AA′correspondingtovectorindices a;conjugationinterchangesprimed
and unprimedindices[13]-[15]. Themetric, gab, and itsinverse, gab, factorize:
gab=ǫABǫA′B′, gab=ǫABǫA′B′, ǫAB=−ǫBA, ǫABǫAC=δC
B.
HereǫABandǫABare the complex conjugates of ǫA′B′andǫA′B′, respectively.
Spinor indices are raised and lowered according to the schem evB=vAǫAB,
vA=ǫABvBandtheirconjugates,asappropriate. Thepointsoftheco-s pinbundle
are labelled by pairs (xa,πB′), withπB′a co-spinor at the point xa. The co-spin
bundle has real dimension eight and maps naturally to the co- tangent bundle via
themap(xa,πB′)→(xa,pb), withpb=πB′πB. Twopointsintheco-spinbundle
maptothesameimage,with panon-zero,ifandonlyiftheirco-spinorsarephase

time with pbeither zero or null and future pointing. There are natural in dexed

Hgenerates the real scaling πA′→etπA′;iEgenerates the phase transformation

Note that NZα= 0,NZα= 0andZαZα= 0. Any function killed by N

12 Thespinortranslationoftheoperatorsof o(T)
We write out the operators Eαβ, its conjugate EαβandEα
βon the spin bundle.
First,fortheoperator Eαβ=Zα∂β−Zβ∂α, wehavethederivatives:
Eαβ(Zγ,Zγ) = (0,Zαδβ
γ−Zβδα
γ).
Write:
Eαβ=Aαβd∂d+Aαβ
C∂C+Aαβ
C′∂C′.
Thenwehave:
0 = (Aαβd∂d+Aαβ
C∂C+Aαβ
C′∂C′)(ixcπC′,πC′) = (iAαβcπC′+Aαβ
C′xc,Aαβ
C′).
SoAαβ
C′= 0andAαβc=πC′XαβC. Then wehave:
πCEαβ=πCXαβDπD′∂d+πCAαβ
E∂E=XαβπC′∂c+πCAαβ
E∂E.
HereXαβ=πCXαβC. Finallyweneed:
πCEαβ(−ixdπD,πD) = (XαβπC′∂c+πCAαβ
E∂E)(−ixdπD,πD)
=πC(−iXαβπD′−iAαβ
Dxd,Aαβ

So weget:
(−iXαβπC′−iAαβ
Cxc,Aαβ
C) = 2Z[αδβ]
γ.
So wehave:
Aαβ
C= 2Z[αδβ]
C, Xαβ= 2Z[αXβ],
XβπC′+δβ
Cxc=iδC′β+λC′Zβ,
XBπC′+xBC′=iλC′xBB′πB′,

XBπC′=−xBC′+iλC′xBB′πB′=iλB′xBB′πC′,
Xβ= (ixbλB′,λB′),πC′λC′=−i.

So ﬁnallywe maywrite:
πCEαβ=XαβπC′∂c+2πCZ[αδβ]
E∂E, πC′Eαβ=XαβπC∂c+2πC′Z[αδβ]E′∂E′.
HereXαβhas entries:
XAB=ǫABxcπC′xB′CλB′=i

XA′B′=−iǫA′B′, XA
B′=ZAXB′−ZB′XA=xA

In particular,wehavethenthecontractions:
XαβXδβ= 0, XαβZβ= 0.
Alsowehave:

So weget:

Now assume that H+ 2 = 0 andN=πD′πD∂D′D= 0. Also note that the
operators NandEcommute. Then wehave:
πC′πC(EαβEδβ+EδβEαβ−2δα
δ−(−iXα
D′XδD∂DD′+ZαδδE′∂E′−Zδδα

provided H+2 =N= 0:
πC′πC(EαβEδβ+EδβEαβ−2δα
δ−Eα
δE)
=−iZαZδ(2πC∂FC′∂F−2πC′∂F′C∂F′+∂CC′E).
The left-hand side of this equation is exactly 2πC′πCtimes the twistor wave op-
erator. We have proved that the spinor description of the ope rator/square, induced by
∂α∂α, ontwistorfunctions f,oftotaldegreeminustwo,isgivenbytheformula:
πC′πC/square(f) =i/parenleftbigg
πC′∂F′∂F′Cf−πC∂F∂FC′∂Ff−1
2∂CC′Ef/parenrightbigg
.
It is not immediately obvious that the right-hand side of thi s equation is propor-
tionaltoπC′πC. Toverifythisdirectly,ﬁrstnotethatsince Nf= 0,wemaywrite
∂af=πA′fA+πAfA′, forsome fA. Thenwe have:
πC′∂F′∂F′Cf−πC∂F∂FC′f−1
2∂CC′Ef
=πC′(h+2)fC−πC(h+2)fC′+πC′πC(∂F′fF′−∂FfF)−1
2E∂CC′f
=1
2((2h+2−E)(πC′fC)−(2h+2+E)(πCfC′))+πC′πC(∂F′fF′−∂FfF)
=1
2(H+2)(πC′fC−πCfC′)+πC′πC(∂F′fF′−∂FfF).
Itremainstoshowthatthequantity hc= (H+2)(πC′fC−πCfC′)isproportional
toπC′πC. Since the co-vector hcis purely imaginary, it sufﬁces to show that
πC′hc= 0. Wehave:
πC′hc=πC′(H+2)(πC′fC−πCfC′)
= (H+1)(πC′(πC′fC−πCfC′)) = (H+1)(πC′(−πC′fC−πCfC′))
=−(H+1)(πC′∂cf) =−πC′(H+2)∂cf=−πC′∂c(H+2)f= 0.
Here we used that fhas total degree minus two and that the operators ∂aandH
commute,whereas HπA′=πA′(H+1).
29
Next we verify that the quantity i(πC′∂F′∂F′Cf−πC∂F∂FC′∂Ff−1
2∂CC′Ef)
is killed by the operator Nand is of total degree −2. That the degree is −2
is immediate, since fis of degree minus two and since Hcommutes with the
operators E,∂a,πA′∂B′andπA∂B. It follows that /square(f)has total degree −4, as
expected. Then wehave,since Ncommuteswith ∂aand withEandkillsf:
πD′πD∂d(i(πC′∂F′∂F′Cf−πC∂F∂FC′∂Ff−1
2∂CC′Ef))
=−i(πC′πD∂d∂D′Cf−πCπD′∂d∂DC′∂Ff) =−i
2πC′πC(∂a∂af−∂a∂af) = 0.
SinceNalso commutes with πC′πC, we have shown that the function /square(f)lies
inH−4,as expected. WeintroducetheLorentzgeneratorsoftheco- spin-bundle:
∂B′
A′=πA′∂B′−1
2πC′∂C′.
Notethat ∂A′
A′= 0, so∂A′B′=∂B′A′. Thenwemay writeouroperatoron H−2as:
πC′πC/square=i(∂F′
C′∂F′C−∂F
C∂FC′).
Finally, let gAandhA′be any smooth functions, not necessarily complex conju-
gatesofeach other, such that ∂af=πA′gA+πAhA′. So wehave gA=fA+πAp
andhA′=fA′−πA′p, forsomesmoothfunction p. Then wehave:
1
2(H+2)(πC′gC−πChC′)+πC′πC(∂F′hF′−∂FgF)
=−iπC′πC/square(f)+(H+2)(πC′πCp)−πC′πC(∂F′(πF′p)+∂F(πFp))
=πC′πC(−i/square(f)+(H+4)p−(h+2)p−(h+2)p) =−iπC′πC/square(f).
We have proved that the twistorwave operator /squaremapsH−2toH−4. Acting on a
functionf(x,π),which obeys Nf= (H+2)f= 0andf(x,−π) =f(x,π),we
have:
πA′πA/square(f) =i(∂B′
A′∂B′A−∂B
A∂BA′).
Alternatively,weﬁrstwrite ∂af=πA′fA+πAfA′,withfAandfA′smooth. Then:
−iπA′πA/square(f) =1
2(H+2)(πA′fA−πAfA′)+πA′πA(∂B′fB′−∂BfB).
Inparticular,ifwearrangethat (H+3)fA= 0and(H+3)fA′= 0(orindeed,if
wearrangejustoneoftheserelations,sincetheotherthenf ollowsautomatically),
thenwehavejust:
∂af=πA′fA+πAfA′,(H+3)fA= 0,(H+3)fA′= 0,/square(f) =i(∂B′fB′−∂BfB).

14 Thespinorintegraloperator: the Ξ-transform
We next construct a spinor integral operator which goes back fromH−4toH−2.
Letf(x,π)beatwistorfunctionoftotaldegree −4(i.e.f∈ H−4), sowehave:
0 =πA′πA∂af(x,π) = (πA′∂A′+πA∂A+4)f(x,π), f(x,−π) =f(x,π).
Thenwedeﬁne the Ξ-transform Ξ(f)(x,η)offbytheformula:
Ξ(f)(x,η) =i/integraldisplay
πA′ηA′>0f(xa+sηAηA′,πC′)dsπB′dπB′πBdπB.
Here the variable sranges over the whole real line. Also the spinor integral is
takenin thespaceofspinors πA′suchthat πA′ηA′is real and positive. Weassume
thatfissufﬁcientlysmoothandwell-behavedatinﬁnitysuchthat alltheintegrals
under consideration converge nicely. Note that the require ment that f(x,π)be
of degree minus four is natural, since the differential form πB′dπB′πBdπBhas
weightfour,sothetotalweightoftheintegrandiszero,asr equiredfortheintegral
tobewell-deﬁned. Ifwewritethetransformoutwiththesymp lecticspinorforms
writteninexplicitly,wehave:
Ξ(f)(x,η) =i/integraldisplay
πA′ηB′ǫA′B′>0f(xa+sǫABǫA′B′ηBηB′,πC′)dsǫD′E′ǫDEπD′dπE′πDdπE.
The point here now is that under a real conformal transformat ionǫAB→uǫAB
withu >0real, combined with the replacement s→u−2sthe integral is invari-
ant. So theintegralisconformallyinvariant.
Weneedtocheckthatthedifferentialformbeingintegrated isclosed. Soweneed
toshowthatif f(πA′)issmoothandobeystherelation: 0 = (πA′∂A′+πA∂A+4)f,
thenthefollowingdifferentialthree-formvanishesident icallyonthespacewhere
πA′ηA′is real and πA′is non-zero, foranyﬁxed non-zero spinor ηA′:
d(fπB′dπB′πBdπB)
= (dπA′∂A′f+dπA∂Af)πB′dπB′πBdπB+fdπB′dπB′πBdπB−fπB′dπB′dπBdπB
=1
2((πA′∂A′+2)f)dπB′dπB′πBdπB−1
2((πA∂A+2)f)πB′dπB′dπBdπB
=1
2((πA′∂A′+2)f)ξ,
ξ=dπB′dπB′πBdπB+πB′dπB′dπBdπB.
31
So it remains to be shown that the differential form ξvanishes identically. To do
this efﬁciently, ﬁrst note that since πA′ηA′is real, by assumption, for each ﬁxed
ηA′, the space of allowable spinors πA′lies in a real vector space of three real
dimensions. So thefour-form Ξ =dξ= 2dπB′dπB′dπBdπBvanishes identically.
Alsothevectorﬁeld H=πA′∂A′+πA∂Aistangenttotherelationobeyedby πA′:
0 =πA′ηA′−πAηA. Contracting ΞwithHgives the form 4ξ. Since the form Ξ
vanishes,sodoes any contractionof Ξ, soξvanishesalso, as required and weare
done.
Notethatusingthetransformation (πA′,ηB′)→(−πA′,−ηB′),weﬁndthat Ξ(f)(x,η) =
Ξ(f)(x,−η). Next note that under the replacement xa→xa+kηAηA′, com-
bined with the variablereplacement s→s−k, theintegral remains invariant, so
Ξ(f)(x,η)isconstantalong thenullgeodesicspray,sois atwistorfun ction:
ηA′ηA∂af(x,η) = 0.
Next if we scale ηA′→pηA′, wherepis real and positive, combined with a vari-
able change s→sp−2, then the integral scales as Ξ(f)(x,pη) =p−2Ξ(f)(x,η).
So wehaveprovedthedesiredrelation:
•Thetransform f→Ξ(f)mapsthespace H−4to thespace H−2.
Wecallthistransformthe Ξtransform. Wecanrewritethe Ξ-transformtoobviate

Here we have used the fact that fis of homogeneous of degree minus four in
the variable πA′under positive real scalings. The point now is that the integ rand
is invariant under complex scalings πA′→sπA′withsany non-zero complex
number, so in the integral we no longer need to constrain πA′by the requirement
thatπA′ηA′be real. Note, however, the key fact that the integral is not i n general
invariantunderphasetransformations ηA′→ληA′with|λ|= 1. Theintegralmay
now be construed as taken over R×S2, where the R-factor corresponds to the
svariable and the S2-factor represents the Riemann sphere corresponding to the
complex projective space of the co-spin space with its origi n deleted. Since this
formulaishomogeneousinthevariable πA′,wecanalsonormalizethespinor πA′

15 Theequation /square◦Ξ = 0
We beginby re-writing the basic Ξ-transform formula, usingthe fact that f(x,π)
isatwistorfunction,somay bewrittenas f(ωA,πA′), whereωA=ixaπA′:

Note that, since f∈ H−4, the function f(ωA,πA′)obeys the scaling relation
f(tωA,tπA′) =t−4f(ωA,πA′), for any positivereal number t. Insidetheintegral,
denote the operator∂

17O(4,4)trialityusingquaternions
Consider three eight-dimensional metric vector spaces Vα,VβandVγ, whose
elements λare represented as pairs of quaternions λ= (P,Q), equipped with an
O(4,4)-metricλ.λ=|Q|2−|P|2. Typicalelementsof Vα,VβandVγaredenoted
α= (A,B),β= (C,D)andγ= (X,Y), respectively. We introduce a triality τ,
areal trilinearform, and threeassociatedproducts,given as follows:
2τ= 2(αβγ) = 2α.(βγ) = 2α.(γβ) = 2β.(γα) = 2β.(αγ) = 2γ.(αβ) = 2γ.(βα)
=−A(CY+XD)+B(CX+YD)−(YC+DX)A+(XC+DY)B
=−C(AY−XB)+D(YB−AX)−(YA−BX)C+(BY−XA)D
=−X(AD−CB)+Y(BD−CA)−(DA−BC)X+(DB−AC)Y.
Notethat τ= (αβγ)∈R. Here thethreereal bilinearproductsare:
(βγ) = (γβ) = (C,D)(X,Y) = (CY+XD,CX+YD)∈Vα,
(γα) = (αγ) = (X,Y)(A,B) = (AY−XB,YB−AX)∈Vβ,
(αβ) = (βα) = (A,B)(C,D) = (AD−CB,BD−CA)∈Vγ.
Thenwehavetheinnerproducts:
(βγ).(βγ) =−|CY+XD|2+|CX+YD|2= (|C|2−|D|2)(|X|2−|Y|2) = (β.β)(γ.γ),
(γα).(γα) =−|AY−XB|2+|YB−AX|2= (|A|2−|B|2)(|X|2−|Y|2) = (γ.γ)(α.α),
(αβ).(αβ) =−|AD−CB|2+|BD−CA|2= (|A|2−|B|2)(|C|2−|D|2) = (α.α)(β.β).
Nextwehavethefollowingrelations:
(α(αβ)) = (AD−CB,BD−CA)(A,B)
= (A(DB−AC)−(AD−CB)B,(DB−AC)B−A(AD−CB))
=−(AA−BB)(C,D) = (α.α)β,
(β(αβ)) = (C,D)(AD−CB,BD−CA)
= (C(BD−CA)+(AD−CB)D,C(AD−CB)+(BD−CA)D)
=−(CC−DD)(A,B) = (β.β)α,
37
(α(γα)) = (A,B)(AY−XB,YB−AX)
= (A(YB−AX)−(AY−XB)B,B(BY−XA)−(YA−BX)A)
=−(AA−BB)(X,Y) = (α.α)γ,
(γ(γα)) = (AY−XB,YB−AX)(X,Y)
= ((AY−XB)Y+X(BY−XA),(YA−BX)X+Y(YB−AX))
=−(XX−YY)(A,B) = (γ.γ)α,
(β(βγ)) = (CY+XD,CX+YD)(C,D)
= ((CY+XD)D−C(CX+YD),(CX+YD)D−C(CY+XD))
=−(CC−DD)(X,Y) = (β.β)γ,
(γ(βγ)) = (X,Y)(CY+XD,CX+YD)
= ((CY+XD)Y−X(XC+DY),Y(CX+YD)−A(CY+XD))
=−(XX−YY)(C,D) = (γ.γ)β.
Bypolarizingtheserelationswithrespecttothereals,weg etaseriesofidentities.
Forexample,when γ′∈Vγ,wehave:
γ(γ′α)+γ′(γα) = 2(γ.γ′)α.
Theotherkey identitiesforatrialitymaybeveriﬁed direct ly:
((γα)(αβ)) = 2(αβγ)α−(α.α)(βγ),
((βγ)(γα)) = 2(αβγ)γ−(γ.γ)(αβ),
((αβ)(βγ)) = 2(αβγ)β−(β.β)(γα).
Wecan also provetheseidentitiesas follows;pick any α′∈Vα. Thenwe have:
α′.((γα)(αβ)) = (α′(γα)).(αβ) =−(α(γα′)).(αβ)+2(α.α′)γ.(αβ)
=−α(αβ)).(γα′)+2(α.α′)γ.(αβ) =α′.(−α.α(βγ)+2(αβγ)).
Since thisformulaholdsfor all α′, and sincetheinnerproduct is non-degenerate,
we infer the relation ((γα)(αβ)) = 2(αβγ)α−(α.α)(βγ). The other identities
areprovedsimilarly.
38
Alternativelywecanadoptthefollowingapproach,usingth efactthattheproducts
aregenericallysurjective: forexample,write β= (αγ′), whenever α.α/ne}ationslash= 0(here
γ′= (αβ)(α.α)−1∈Vγ). Then wehave:
((γα)(αβ))−2α(αβγ)+α.α(βγ)= ((γα)(α(αγ′)))−2α(α(αγ′)).γ+α.α((αγ′)γ)
= (α.α)((γ′(γα))+(γ(γ′α))−2(γ′.γ)α) = 0.
Since this relation holds for almost all α∈Vα, by continuity, it holds for all α.
Finally given any α∈Vα, there is a natural mapping denoted ˆα:Vβ⊕Vγ→
Vβ⊕Vγgiven by the formula: ˆα(β⊕γ) = ((αγ)⊕(αβ)). Then the operators
{ˆα:α∈Vα}, which depend linearly on α, represent the Clifford algebra of
O(4,4),sincewehave ˆα2= (α.α)I,whereIistheidentityoperatoron Vβ⊕Vγ.
Inparticularthespace Vβ⊕Vγmayberegardedas thespinspacefor Vα. Itthen
follows from the structure theory of the representations of Clifford algebras that
theO(4,4)-triality we have constructed is unique up to isomorphism. O f course,
wealsohavethat Vγ⊕Vαmaybeconsideredasthespinspacefor VαandVα⊕Vβ
maybeconsidered as thespinspacefor Vγ.
We say that α∈Vαandβ∈Vβareincidentif and only if (αβ) = 0. Multi-
plying this condition by α, we get(α.α)β= 0; multiplyinginstead by β, we get
(β.β)α= 0. Itfollowsthatif αandβareincident,theneither α= 0,orβ= 0or
bothαandβarenullvectors. Given α/ne}ationslash= 0,withα.α= 0,thespaceofall βsuch
thatαβ= 0turnsouttobefour-dimensional. Notealsothatif (αβ) = (αβ′) = 0,
thenwehave:
0 =β′(αβ)+β(αβ′) = 2(β.β′)α.
Soβandβ′are necessarily orthogonal, if α/ne}ationslash= 0. Using our quaternionicformal-
ism,thecondition (A,B)(C,D) = 0becomes:
AD−CB=BD−CA= 0.
For(A,B)non-zero and null we have |A|2=|B|2/ne}ationslash= 0. So we may write
(C,D) = (As,tB), forsomequaternions sandt. Then weneed:
0 =AtB−AsB,0 =BBt−sAA=|B|2(t−s).
Thegeneralsolutionisjust s=tand wehave (C,D)incidentwith (A,B)/ne}ationslash= 0if
and only if |A|2=|B|2/ne}ationslash= 0and(C,D) = (At,tB), for somequaternion t. Note
that the space of solutions is a four-dimensional completel y null subspace of Vβ,

18 Thetwistorapproachto O(4,4)-triality
We represent a twistor Zαby a pair of quaternions: Zα= (C,D). TheO(4,4)-
innerproductof Zαwith itselfis −|C|2+|D|2=ZαZα. We select aunit imagi-
nary quaternion iand writeany quaternion quniquely as sum q=q1+q2, where
q1i=iq1(equivalently iq1i=−q1) andq2i=−iq2(equivalently iq2i=q2);
explicitly we have and q1=1
2(q−iqi)andq2=1
2(q+iqi). Ifjandkare unit
imaginary quaternions, such that ij=−ji=kand ifq=t+xi+yj+zk,
witht,x,y,zreal numbers, then iqi=−t−xi+yj+zk, soq1=t+xiand
q2=yj+zk= (y+iz)j=j(y−iz). Weidentifythe(commutative)subalgebra
of all the quaternions qsuch that q=q1, equivalently qi=iq, with the complex
numbersC. Then,forany q∈CandZα= (C,D),wedeﬁne (qZ)α= (Cq,qD),
making the space of all twistors into a four-dimensional com plex vector space.
WriteC=c0+jc1andD=d0+d1j, wherec0,c1,d0andd1are complex
numbers. Then we may represent Zαby the complex four-vector (c0,c1,d0,d1),
withtheaction of Cjustgivenbyleft multiplication. Theconjugate(dual)vec tor
is thenZα= (−c0,−c1,d0,d1). Consider the twistor description of the triality
transformation Zα= (C,D)→Uα= (CY+XD,CX+YD), where(X,Y)
are given quaternions. This is real linear in the variables XandY, so to under-
stand this action it sufﬁces to take the four cases: Y=x∈C,Y=j,Y=k,
X=x0+jx1,wherex0andx1are complexnumbers.
•Y=xis justthetransformation Zα→Uα=xZα.
•Y=jmapsZα= (c0,c1,d0,d1)toUα= (−c1,c0,−d1,d0) =AβαZβ,

(The matrix multiplicationhere is acts on Zβfrom the left with Zβtreated

Xαβ=1

Hereǫαβγδis completely skew and is chosen such that ǫ1234=−1. Finally the

Notethat the O(4,4)-triality2τrelatingZα= (C,D),(X,Y)andWα= (A,B)

Thethreetrialityproductsare now:
(Zα,(x,Xαβ)) =Wα=xZα+XβαZβ,

Forthelast oftheseproducts,notethat wehave:

Weverifydirectly thetrialityproductstructure:

19 Trialityandtheinvariant Ξ-transform
Weassumethatthetwistorspaceisequippedwithaﬁxedalter natingtensor, ǫαβγδ,
with complex conjugate ǫαβγδ, normalized by the relation ǫαβγδǫαβγδ= 24. Ex-
plicitlywemaytake ǫAB
C′D′=ǫABǫC′D′and anyspinorpartsof ǫαβγδ, withthree
or more unprimed indices, or three or more primed indices, va nish. Let Zαbe a
twistor,Wαa dual twistor and let Xαβbe a skew twistor, which obeys the real-
ity condition Xαβ=1
2ǫαβγδXγδ. If the twistor Xαβhas entries XAB=uǫAB,
XA
B′=ixA
B′,XA′B′=vǫA′B′withuandvcomplex and xaa complex four-
vector, then Yαβ=1
2ǫαβγδXγδhas entries YAB=1

YA′B′=1
2ǫA′B′ǫCDvǫCD=vǫA′B′andYA
B′=−ǫACǫB′D′XD
C′=−ixA
B′. Then
the reality condition boils down to the requirement that uandvbe real numbers
and thatxabe a real four vector. Note that this reality condition entai ls the rela-
tion:
4XαβXγβ=δα
γXρσXρσ.
Also we have XαβXαβ= 2uv+ 2vu+ 2XA
B′XB
A′= 2(uv+vu+xaxa). In
particularif Xαβobeystherealitycondition,then XαβXαβ= 4uv+2xaxa(where
now(u,v,xa)are real). Note that the signatureof the quadraticform XαβXαβis
(4,8), for general Xαβand(2,4), whenXαβobeys the reality condition. As
studiedintheprevioussection,thetwistortrialityformu lais:
τ=ZαWβXαβ+ZαWβXαβ+xZαWα+xZαWα.
Differentiating τwithrespect to Wα, wegettheincidencerelations:
ZαXαβ+xZβ= 0,
Multiplyingthisformulaby 4Xγβ,weget:
0 =XρσXρσZγ−4xZβXβγ=Zα(XρσXρσ+4xx).
It quickly follows that either Zα= 0, orXαβ= 0andx= 0, orZαZα=
XαβXαβ+ 4xx= 0. Note that provided Xαβobeys the reality condition, the
signatureofthequadraticform XαβXαβ+4xx= 2(2uv+xaxa+2xx)is(4,4),
the same as that of the basic twistor spaces. Differentiatin gτwith respect to x
andXαβwegettheincidencerelationsforthetwistors ZαandWα:
ZαWα= 0,2Z[αWβ]=−ǫαβγδZγWδ.
43
Note that the incidence condition is invariant under real sc alings of the twistors
ZαandWα, but not under complex scalings. Assume that Zαis incident with
Wα, whereWα/ne}ationslash= 0is givenand Zαis variable. If WαWα/ne}ationslash= 0, theonly solution
isZα= 0. WhenWαWα= 0, the solution space is a real vector space of four
dimensions and every solution is null: ZαZα= 0. Henceforth we take Wαto
be non-zero and null. In (conformally compactiﬁed) real Min kowski space-time,
sinceWαis null,Wαselects a null geodesic. For convenience, we assume that
Wαdoesnotlieonthenullconeatinﬁnity. Alsoforconvenience ,wedeletefrom
oursolutionspacethesolutions Zα,forwhich ZαandWαarelinearlydependent
overthe complex numbers. Then Zαis non-zero and null, so it also determines a
(variable)nullgeodesic. Forconvenience,weassumethatt hesenullgeodesicsdo
not meet at inﬁnity. Then, since ZαWα= 0, thenull geodesicrepresented by Zα
meets that of Wαat a (variable, ﬁnite) point of the null geodesic of Wα. We may
writeWα= (ηA,−ixBA′ηB), for some ﬁxed real vector xaand ﬁxed non-zero
spinorηA. Then, conjugating, we have Wα= (ixB′AηB′,ηA′). Also the twistor
Zαmay be written: Zα= (i(xAB′+sηAηB′)πB′,πA′), wheresis a real variable
andπA′is a non-zero variable spinor subject to the condition that πA′ηA′be pure
imaginary and non-zero. Write πA′ηA′=iu, whereuis real and non-zero. Note
thatthecondition u/ne}ationslash= 0guaranteesthat ZαandWαarelinearlyindependentover
the complex numbers and that they meet at a ﬁnite point, as req uired. Then we
have:
dZα=−uds(ηA,0)+(i(xAB′+sηAηB′)dπB′,dπA′).
Nowwemaywrite dπA′=απA′+βηA′,wheretheone-form βiscomplexwhereas
theone-form αisreal. Notethat πA′dπA′=−iuβ. Alsodeﬁnetheﬁxedauxiliary
twistorUα= (ηA,0)(soUα= (0,ηA′). Note that the twistors Uα,ZαandWα
arelinearly independent. Alsowe have ZαUα=iu. Then wehave:
dZα=−udsUα+αZα+βWα.
In particularwehaveforthecontactform:

Letf(Z)be a given twistor function of degree minus four: f(tZ) =t−4f(Z),
for any real non-zero real number t. The invariant Ξ-transform of f(Z)is by
deﬁnition:
Ξ(f,θ,W) =/integraldisplay
Zincident with Wf(Z)ω3.
HereWαis any non-zero null twistor and f(Z)is deﬁned on N′. The integral is
taken overa three-sphere and always converges, with theres ultvarying smoothly
withW. Comparing with our original deﬁnition of the transform Ξ(f), we ﬁnd
thatwehaveprovedthefundamentalfact:
•Ξ(f,θ,W) = ΨΞ(f) = (WαWβθαΣβ+WαWβθγθγθαθβ+WαWβθαΣβ)Ξ(f).
Note that since the left-hand side of this equation is plainl y invariant under the
scalingWα→tWα, wheretis any real non-zero number, so we see immediately
thatΞ(f)must be of degree minus two in Wα, which was previously established
bydirect calculation.

Hereθis a vector-valued Grassman variable. We represent Zby the quaternion
pair(C,D)andWbythequaternionpair (A,B),suchthattheincidencecondition
ofZwithWreads(C,D) = (At,tB),forsomequaternion t,where|C|=|D| /ne}ationslash=
0and|A|=|B| /ne}ationslash= 0. Alsof(Z)is homogeneous of degree minus four, so
the integral is both projectively invariant and invariant u nder the non-zero real
scalings of W, so we may assume without loss of generality that |A|2=|B|2=
|C|2=|D|2=|t|2= 1. Writeθ= (α,β), whereαandβare quaternion-
valued Grassman variables, such that Z.θ=αC+Dβ+Cα+βDanddZ.θ=
−αdC+dDβ+dCα−βdD. Substitutingfor Zin termsof W,wehave:
Z.θ=αAt+tBβ+tAα+βBt,
dZ.θ=−αAdt+dtBβ+dtAα−βBdt.
Next write α=Aγandβ=δB, whereγ=Aαandδ=βBare Grassman
variables.
Thenwehave:
Z.θ=γt+tδ+tγ+δt,
dZ.θ=−γdt+dtδ+dtγ−δdt.
UsingR4indices,wemay write:
Z.θ=ǫata, dZ.θ=−ǫbdtb, ǫa= 2(γa+δa).

So after factoring out the form ΩW(θ), and writing pfort,gforAandhforB,

This exactly agrees with our original Ξ-transform on the Lie group SU(2,C)×

1 Introduction
This paper can be considered as a continuation of our paper [13]. Na mely, we discuss some
multiple hypergeometric transformation formulas arising from the b alanced duality transfor-
mation formula through the symmetry in this paper. We obtain some t ransformation formulas
with diﬀerent dimensions by taking certain limits of the balanced duality transformation. By
combining some of them, we give some transformation formulas for Anbasic hypergeometric
series. Theyinclude somegeneralizationsofWatson, Searsand non terminatingand terminating
8W7transformations.

where [c]k=c(c+1)···(c+k−1) is Pochhammer symbol and [ d1,···,dr]k= [d1]k···[dr]k.
The very well-poised hypergeometric series have nice properties su ch as the existence of
various kinds of summation and transformation formulas which cont ains more parameters than
other hypergeometric series and they have reciprocal structur e (For precise see an excellent
exposition by G.E. Andrews [1]). In [2], W.N.Bailey derived the following tra nsformation
formula for terminating balanced and very well-poised 9F8series which is nowadays called the
Bailey transformation formula:

,
whereλ= 1 + 2a−b−c−d, and the parameters are subject to the restriction (called as
balancing condition) that
2+3a=b+c+d+e+f+g−N. (1.3)
Among various hypergeometric transformation formulas, the Baile y transformation itself
(1.2) and its special and limiting cases, including their basic and elliptic an alogues, have many
signiﬁcant applications in various branches of mathematics and math ematical physics.
On the other hand, Holman, Biedenharn and Louck [9], [10] introduc ed a class of multi-
ple generalization of hypergeometric series in need of the explicit exp ressions of the Clebsch-
Gordan coeﬃcients of the tensor product of certain irreducible re presentations of the Lie group
SU(n+1). In the series of papers, S.Milne [19] introduced its basic analogu e and investigated
further. In the course of works (see the expository paper by Miln e [22] and references therein),
he and his collaborators succeeded to obtain some multiple hypergeo metric transformation and
summation formulas by using a certain rational function identity whic h is nowadays referred as
Milne‘s fundamental lemma. After that, many methods of the deriva tion of multiple hyperge-
ometric identities have been worked out such as ingenious uses of ce rtain matrix techniques by
Krattenthaler, Schlosser, Milne, Lilly and Newcomb, see [4], [21], [23], [24].
In the previous work [13], we derived a certain generalization of the E uler transformation
formula for multiple (basic) hypergeometric series with diﬀerent dime nsions by using the tech-
niques in the theory of Macdonald polynomials and Macdonald‘s q-diﬀerence operators. By
interpreting our multiple Euler transformation formula as the gener ating series, we further
obtained several types of multiple hypergeometric summations and transformations.
Among these, we consider the (balanced) duality transformation formula (2.12) which gen-
eralize the following 9F8transformation (see Bailey‘s book [3]):

,
with the balancing condition (1.3), as the formula of particular import ance. (1.4) is diﬀerent
from (1.2), but (1.4) can be obtained by duplicating (1.2). In the join t work with M.Noumi [15],
we derived an analogous formula ((3.17) of [15]) for elliptic hypergeom etric series introduced
by Frenkel and Turaev [5] by starting from the Frobenius determ inant and proposed the notion
of (balanced) duality transformation there.
In this paper, we present an alternative approach by starting fro m the balanced duality
transformation formula for multiple hypergeometric series of type A. In Section 3, we present
some transformationformula for basic hypergeometricseries oft ypeAwith diﬀerent dimension.
They include most of results in our previous work [13]. What is remark able is that from the
balanced duality transformation formula, one can obtain multiple Eule r transformation formula
itself.
By iterating twice a special case of our Sears transformation form ula (see section 7 in [13]),
we veriﬁed an AnSears transformation formula in [12]. Later by the same idea as abov e, we
obtained in [15] two types of AnBailey transformation formulas: one of which is previously
2
known by Milne and Newcomb [24] in basic case and Rosengren [27] in ellipt ic case and another
hasappearedto be new in both cases. In Section 4, wefurther emp loythis idea to obtainseveral
Anbasic hypergeometric transformations which generalize Watson, S ears and nonterminating
8W7transformations. They includes known ones due to Milne and his collab orators. We will
see here that our class of multiple hypergeometric transformation s shed a light to the structure
of someAnhypergeometric transformation formulas.
2 Preliminaries
In this section, we give some notations for multiple basic hypergeome tric series and present the
balanced duality transformation formula. We basically refer the not ations ofq-series and basic
hypergeometric series from the book by Gasper and Rahman [7]. Th roughout of this paper,
we assume that qis a complex number under the condition 0 <|q|<1. We deﬁne q−shifted
factorial as
(a)∞:= (a;q)∞=/productdisplay
n∈N(1−aqn),(a)k:= (a;q)k=(a)∞
(aqk)∞fork∈C.(2.1)
where, unless stated otherwise, we omit the basis q. In this paper we employ the notation as
(a1)k·(a2)k···(an)k= (a1,a2,···,an)k. (2.2)

withr+1 numerator parameters a0,a1,···,ar+1andrdenominator parameters c1,···,cr. We
callr+1φrseriesk-balanced if qka1a2···ar+1=c1···crandu=q: a 1-balanced series is called
balanced (or Saalsch¨ utzian). An r+1φrseries is called well-poised if a0q=a1c1=···=arcr.
In addition, if a1=q√a0anda2=−q√a0, then the r+1φris called very well-poised. We
denote the very well-poised basic hypergeometric series r+3φr+2asr+3Wr+2series deﬁned by
the following:
r+3Wr+2[s;{ai}r;q;u] :=r+3φr+2/bracketleftbiggs, q√s,−q√s,{ai}r√s,−√s,{sq/ai}r;q;u/bracketrightbigg
(2.4)

k∈N1−sq2k

Furthermore, all of the very well-poised basic hypergeometric ser iesr+3Wr+2in this paper, the
parameters s,a1,···arand the argument satisfy the very-well-poised-balancing condition

with either the plus and minus sign. We call a r+3Wr+2series very-well-poised-balancedif (2.5)
holds. Note that a very-well-poised-balanced r+3Wr+2series is (1-)balanced if
a1···ar=sr−1

Now, we note the conventions for naming series as Anbasic hypergeometric series (or basic
hypergeometric series in SU(n+1)). Letγ= (γ1,···,γn)∈Nnbe a multi-index. We denote
∆(x) :=/productdisplay
1≤i<j≤n(xi−xj) and ∆( xqγ) :=/productdisplay
1≤i<j≤n(xiqγi−xjqγj), (2.7)

∆(x)H(γ) (2.8)
which reduce to basic hypergeometric series r+1φrfor a nonnegative integer rwhenn= 1 and
symmetric with respect to the subscript 1 ≤i≤nasAnbasic hypergeometric series. We call
such a series balanced if it reduces to a balanced series when n= 1. Very well-poised and so on
are deﬁned similarly. The subscript nin the label Anattached to the series is the dimension of
the multiple series (2.8).
In our previous work [13], we derived a hypergeometric transforma tion formula for multiple
basic hypergeometric series of type Ageneralizing the following transformation for terminating
balanced 10W9series in the one dimensional case:
10W9/bracketleftbiga;b,c,d,e,f,µfqN,q−N;q;q/bracketrightbig

,
whereµ=a3q2/bcdef2. Note that (2.9) is a basic analogue of (1.4). The transformation (2 .9)
can be obtained by iterating the Bailey transformation formula for 10W9series
10W9/bracketleftbig
a;b,c,d,e,f,λaqN+1/ef,q−N;q;q/bracketrightbig

(λ=a2q/bcd),
twice. Note also that (2.10) is a basic analogue of (1.2).
To simplify the expressions for multiple very well-poised series, we intr oduce the notation
ofWn,mseries as the following:

The very starting point of all the discussions of the present paper is thebalanced duality
transformation formula (Corollary 6.3 of [13] with a diﬀerent notation) between the Wn,m+2

The balanced duality transformation formula (2.12) corresponds t o the case when m,n≥2
of (2.15) by a rearrangement of parameters in the multiple basic hyp ergeometric series. Note
that, in the case when m=n= 1, (2.15) becomes tautological. We shall also remark that
the remaining case ( m= 1,n≥2) corresponds to the AnJackson summation formula for

these facts, the informed readers might see [13] for ordinary and basic case and Noumi and the
author [15] for elliptic case.
Remark 2.1.In the case when n= 1 andx1= 1, (2.16) reduces to the Jackson summation
formula for terminating balanced 8W7series:
8W7[a;b,c,d,e,q−N;q;q] =(aq,aq/bc,aq/bd,aq/cd )N
(aq/bcd,aq/b,aq/c,aq/d )N,(a2qN+1=bcde).(2.17)
We also mention that (2.16) can be obtained by letting aq=efin (2.13) and by relabeling the
parameters.
3 Limit cases
In this section, we shall show that several transformation formu las with diﬀerent dimension can
be obtained from the balanced duality transformation formula (2.12 ) by taking certain limits.
We see that most of principal transformation formulas in [13] which h ave been obtained by
taking a certain coeﬃcient in the multiple Euler transformation formu la (2.14) can be recovered
and we ﬁnd some new transformation formulas. Furthermore we sh ow that (2.14) itself can be
acquired in this manner.
In addition, we shall write down the cases when the dimension of summ and in each side
of the transformation is one with particular attention. We consider them as particularly sig-
niﬁcant ones since they have an extra symmetry. We will explore som eAnhypergeometric
transformations by using some of them in the next section.

Proof.Take the limit e→ ∞in (2.12). By rearranging the parameter as f→e, we arrive at

Remark 3.1.The transformation formula (3.1) has already appeared in Section 6 .1 of our
previous work [13] with a diﬀerent notation. Later Rosengren has a lso obtained in [26] by using
his reduction formula of Karlsson-Minton type. In contract to tha t we see here, as is mentioned
in [26], the balanced duality transformation formula (2.12) can also be considered as a special
case of (3.1). Indeed, in [13] though we have started the derivatio n of (3.1) from the multiple
Euler transformation (2.14) in general case, (2.12) has been obta ined from the ”zero”-balanced
case of (2.14).

Remark 3.3.The reason why we call (3.7) as the inverse of the (non-balanced) d uality transfor-
mation (3.1) is that the transformations which one obtain by applying (3.1) and (3.7) in both
order turn out to be identical as a (multiple) hypergeometric series . Note also that (3.7) can be
obtained by relabeling parameters in (3.1) appropriately. However, we will use special cases of
these transformations to establish an Angeneralization of basic hypergeometric transformation
formulas in the next section.

Remark 3.5.Similarly to the expression (2.15) for the balanced duality transform ation formula

Here we give a remark on the convergence of multiple series.
Remark 3.8.(Convergence of the multiple series) In the course of obtaining an inﬁnite
multiple sum identity such as (3.17), one needs to ensure the limiting pr ocedure. To justify
the process, one is required to use the dominated convergence th eorem. Furthermore, to ﬁnd
the convergence condition of the dominated series such as the ser ies in (3.17), one can quote
the ratio test for multiple power series in classical work by J.Horn [11 ]. Since the details of
such justiﬁcations in this paper are all in the same line as the corresp onding discussions in
Milne-Newcomb [24] (see also Milne [21] and Milne-Newcomb [25]), we shall omit in this paper.
We shall propose the following special case, namely a transformatio n formula between An
m+2φm+1serieswithintegerparameterdiﬀerencesand Amterminatingbalanced n+2φn+1series:

Remark 3.14.In the case when n= 1 andx1= 1, (3.42) reduces to the Rogers‘ summation
formula for terminating 6W5series (3.6).
As we have seen in this section, one can recover our previous result s in [13] from the bal-
anced duality transformation formula (2.12) by limiting procedures. Combining with results in
[13] and Rosengren [26], one can consider the master formula for mu ltiple basic hypergeomet-
ric transformations of type Awith diﬀerent dimensions presented in this section to either of
multiple basic Euler transformation (2.14), Sears transformation ( 3.14), (non balanced) duality
transformation (3.1) and balanced duality transformation formula (2.12).
4Anhypergeometric transformations
In this section, wepresentseveralhypergeometrictransforma tionformulaswith samedimension
n(for multiple basic hypergeometric series of type An) by combining some special cases of hy-
pergeometric transformation with diﬀerent dimensions which we hav e obtained in the previous
section. It contains new transformation formulas and some of the se are previously known by
Milne and hiscollaborators(see [23], [24], and [22]). However,ourproo fsofthem arecompletely
diﬀerent from theirs and seem to be simpler.
4.1AnWatson transformations
In this subsection and next, we derive several Angeneralization of the Watson transformation
formula between terminating 8W7series and terminating balanced 4φ3series ( (2.5.1) in [7] ):

Especially, we give two types of AnWatson transformation formula whose series in the left
hand side are expressible in terms of Wn,2series here. We will use a special case ( m= 1 (3.3))
of the (non-balanced) duality transformation formula (3.1) and sp ecial cases of 4φ3series of
typeAto the identities below. To be precise, we produce them according to the following

here we give in the useful form for the present proof and latter us es in this section, as (B)in
the above diagram. Note that both of the series in the right hand sid e of (3.3) and that in the
left hand side of (4.3) satisfy same condition as basic hypergeometr ic series: namely they are
terminating balanced n+3φn+2series. On the set of variables
({(aq/bie)xi}n,aq/ce,aq/de,a2q2/Bcde,{(aq/e)xi}n), (4.4)
we consider the following change of variables:
˜a=aq/ce, ˜c=aq/de, ˜e=a2q2/Bcde
˜ui= (aq/bie)xi,˜vi= (aq/e)xi(i= 1,···,n). (4.5)
For given function ψ, we denote by ˜ψ=ψ(a,c,e,{ui}n,{vi}n) the function that is obtained by
replacing the variables ( a,c,e,{ui}n,{vi}n) by (˜a,˜c,···).In this case, the change of variables
17
(4.5) is a transposition inside of each sets of numerator parameter s inn+3φn+2series and of
denominator parameters. Hence, the right hand side of (3.3) is inva riant under this change of
variables. By applying (4.3) to the series the right hand side in (3.3), t his invariance implies
(4.2).
Wealsogivesimilartransformationformulaformultiple serieswhichter minateswith respect
to a certain multi-index. In this paper, we call such transformation formulasas rectangular and
transformations for the multiple series which terminates with respe ct to the length of multi-
indices as triangular .

Proof.We ﬁrst write the product factor in the right hand side of (4.2) as a q uotient of inﬁnite
products using (2.1). Set bi=q−miin (4.2), and notice that (4.6) is true for b=q−Nfor all
nonnegative integer N. Clear the denominators in (4.6). Then we ﬁnd that it is a polynomial
identity inb−1with an inﬁnite number of roots. Thus, (4.6) is true for arbitrary b.
All the corollaries in this section can be proved by similar arguments fr om the formulas in
the preceding propositions. So, hereafter we will not repeat this p rocedure in the rest of this
paper.
Remark 4.1.(4.6) has appeared in Theorem 6.1 of Milne and Lilly [23].

here we present in a modiﬁed form, as (B). Notice that both of the series in the right hand side
of (3.3) and that in the left hand side of (4.8) are terminating balance dn+3φn+2series. In this
case, we consider the following change of variables
˜a=aq/ce, ˜c=aq/de, ˜e=a2q2/Bcde
˜ui= (aq/bie)xi,˜vi= (aq/e)xi(i= 1,···,n). (4.9)
Since this change of variables is same as (4.5) in the proof of Proposit ion 4.1. one can obtain
the desired identity (4.7) by plugging (4.8) to the series in the right ha nd side of (3.3) according
to this change of variables.

4.2 Another type of AnWatson transformation
Here, we present a yet another AnWatson transformation with a diﬀerent form in the series
in both sides from those in the previous subsection. We will use the m= 1 case of the
terminating 8W7transformation (3.40) of type Ain Section 3.3. and the n= 1 case of the
duality transformation formula in a modiﬁed form to produce. We con struct it according to
the following procedure:

to obtain. It is not hard to see that both of the series in the right ha nd side of (3.40) and in
the left hand side of (4.13) satisfy the same condition: they are 2n+6W2n+5series and very-
well-poised-balanced. We consider the following change of variables:
˜a=q−Ne/d, ˜b=aq/cd, ˜d=e, (4.14)
˜ui= (aq/bid)xi,˜vi= (q−Ne/a)x−1
i(i= 1,···,n),
which is a transposition of the variables in 2n+6W2n+5series in (3.40). Note that r+3Wr+2
series is symmetric with respect to the variables a1,···,ar. So the series in the right hand side
of (3.40) is invariant under this change of variables. This invariance im plies (4.12) by applying
(4.13) according to the change of variables (4.14).

4.3AnSears transformations
In this and next subsection, we present some Angeneralizations of the Sears transformation
formula for terminating balanced 4φ3series (3.16). In particular, we will prove two AnSears
transformations whose form of the series in both sides are same as that in the right hand
side of the AnWatson transformation formulas in Section 4.1. We produce these id entities by
combining certain special cases of 4φ3series of type Ain Section 3.2. Our way to prove them
is ﬁgured as the following diagram:

Proof.We use (3.27) as (A)and (4.8) as (B)in the above diagram. It is not hard to see
that both of the series in the right hand side of (3.27) and in the left h and side in (4.8) are
terminating balanced n+3φn+2series. We consider the following change of variables:
˜a=e/a, ˜c=f/a, ˜e=def/a2Bc. (4.21)
˜ui=ef
abiczi,˜vi=ef
aczi(1≤i≤n).
Note that the series in the right hand side of (3.27) is invariant under this change of variables.
Applying (4.8) to the n+3φn+2series in the right hand side in (3.27) leads to the desired result
(4.20).
In [12], we have already shown that (4.20) can also be obtained by com bining (3.15) as (A)
and (4.3) as (B). In this case, The change of variables is given by
˜a=d/c, ˜c=a, ˜e=de/Bc. (4.22)
˜ui=d

˜ui=d

For the rest, one can easily verify in a similar way as the proof of Prop osition 4.4.
Note that (4.24) can also be obtained by combining (3.27) as (A)and (4.3) as (B). In this
case, the change of variables is given by

Remark 4.5.In the case when n= 1 andx1= 1, all of Anterminating balanced 4φ3trans-
formation formulas (4.20), (4.23), (4.24) and (4.27) reduce to the Sears transformation (3.16).
Especially, (4.20) has already appeared in our previous work [12] and (4.27) is originally due
to Milne and Lilly (Theorem 6.5 in [23]). Note also that (4.20) can be prov ed by duplicating
(4.24)
Remark 4.6.TwoAnWatson transformations (4.2) and (4.7) transpose to one anothe r byAn
Searstransformationformula(4.24). Similarly, two AnWatsontransformations(4.6) and (4.10)
transpose to one another by AnSears transformation formula (4.27).
4.4 Another type of AnSears transformation
Here, we give a yet another type of AnSears transformation formula whose form of the series
in both sides are the same as that in the right hand side of AnWatson transformation formulas
in Section 4.2. We use the m= 1 case (3.8) of the inversion of the duality transformation (3.7)
and a certain special case (4.13) of the duality transformation for mula (3.1). Our road map is
as follows:

Proof.We use (3.8) and (4.13). Note that both of the series in the right han d side of (3.8) and
in the left hand side of (4.13) are very-well-poised-balanced 2n+6W2n+5series. In this case, we
consider the following change of variables:
˜a=de2q−1
Abc, ˜b=e/b, ˜d=e/c, (4.29)
˜ui= (deq−1/Abc)x−1
i,˜vi= (e/ai)xi(i= 1,···,n),
which is a transposition of the variables in 2n+6W2n+5series in (3.8). Since the series in the
right hand side of (3.8) is invariant under this change of variables. Th is invariance implies the
desired result (4.28) by applying (4.13) according to the change (4.2 9).

Remark 4.7.(4.30) has originally appeared as Theorem 6.8 in Milne-Lilly [23]. Though th ey
referred as CrSears transformation formula there, the sums in both side of (4.30 ) areAn4φ3
series. For their point of view, it may be precise to refer it as AnSears transformation formula
arising from CnBailey transform .
In the case when n= 1 andx1= 1, (4.28) and (4.30) reduce to the Sears transformation
(3.16). We also note that (4.28) can be obtained from AnBailey transformation (4.11) in the
following way: First we replace d→aq/dandf→aq/fin (4.11). Then let the parameter a
tends to inﬁnity in the resulting equation. Finally rearrange the para meters appropriately.
4.5 Nonterminating 8W7transformations
Here we show a Annonterminating 8W7transformation formula. Our tool to produce it is
m= 1 case (3.35) of of the nonterminating 8W7transformation formula (3.34) in Section 3.3.
One can see the way to prove the identity as

As we have seen in this section, our discussion here may implies not only that our class of
multiple hypergeometric transformations in the previous section ar e broader class than Milne‘s
class of transformation in Anbut also that our class contains more precise informations. In
our terminology, one may see that Milne‘s hypergeometric transfor mations have extra hidden
symmetries in the one dimensional (generalized) hypergeometric se ries.

ABSTRACT . There is a canonical unitary transformation from L2(R)
onto the Fock space F2, called the Bargmann transform. We study the
action of the Bargmann transform on several classical integ ral opera-
tors onL2(R), includingthe fractional Fourier transform,the fraction al
Hilberttransform,andthe wavelettransform.

The Bargmann transform is an old tool in mathematical analys is and
mathematical physics. See [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8] and references th ere. In this
article we study the action of the Bargmann transform on seve ral classical
integral operators on L2(R). The unitarily equivalent version of these op-
erators on F2sometimes takes amazingly simple form, sometimes reveals
interesting properties, and sometimes suggests natural ne w questions. It is
our hope that this article will generate some new interest in this classical
areaofmathematicalanalysis.

Obviously, the integral representation above is well deﬁne d ifsinα/ne}ationslash= 0.
We deﬁne Fα(f)(x) =f(x)ifα= 0andFα(f)(x) =f(−x)ifα=±π.
Thisisconsistentwiththeintegralrepresentationabovei nthesensethat
lim

Since the trigonometric functions cscandcotare periodic with period

2
andα=−π
2, theα-angle fractional Fourier transform becomes the usual
Fourier transform and the inverse Fourier transform, respe ctively. See [4,
10]formoreinformationabout thefractional Fouriertrans forms.
It is not at all clear from the deﬁnition that Fαis bounded and invertible
onL2(R). Therearealsoissuesconcerningconvergence: itisnotcle arthat
the integral deﬁning Fα(f)converges in L2(R)for arbitrary f∈L2(R).
The situationwill change dramatically once we translate Fαto an operator
on the Fock space. In other words, we will show that, under the Bargmann
transform, the operator Fα:L2(R)→L2(R)is unitarily equivalent to an
extremelysimpleoperatorontheFock space F2.
Theorem 3. The operator

isgiven by Tf(z) =f(e−iαz)forallf∈F2.
Proof.ForthepurposeofapplyingFubini’stheoreminthecalculat ionsbe-

dense inF2, and under the inverse Bargmann transform, they become the
HermitepolynomialstimestheGaussfunction,which haveve rygoodinte-

BARGMANN TRANSFORM 7
Since the classical Fourier transform Fis justFαwithα=π
2, we see
that the Fourier transform on L2(R)is unitarily equivalent to the operator
f(z)→f(−iz)onF2. This is well known to experts in the ﬁeld and can
befoundin[1, 2].
As a consequence of Theorem 3, we immediately derive a number of
basic properties for the fractional Fourier transform Fα. In particular, we
obtain an alternative proof of the fractional Fourier inver sion formula and
theassociated Plancherel’sformula.
Corollary4. Theα-anglefractionalFouriertransform Fαis a unitaryop-
eratoron L2(R), so that/integraldisplay

forallf∈L2(R). Furthermore, (Fα)−1=F−α.
Proof.Thisisobviousfromtheunitarilyequivalentformof FαontheFock
space. /square
The following result is also clear from our new representati on of the
fractional Fourier transform on the Fock space, because an e ntire function
uniquelydeterminesitsTaylorcoefﬁcients.
Corollary 5. For each n≥0the Hermite function hnis an eigenvector
ofthefractionalFouriertransform Fαandthecorrespondingeigenvalueis
e−inα.
The corollary above actually gives the complete spectral pi cture for the
unitary operator FαonL2(R). More speciﬁcally, if αis a rational multiple
ofπ, then thespectrumof Fα:L2(R)→L2(R)isgivenby
σ(Fα) =/braceleftbig
e−inα:n= 0,1,2,···/bracerightbig
,
which consists of only ﬁnitely many points on the unit circle . Ifαis an
irrational multiple of π, thenσ(Fα)is the entire unit circle. In particular,
if we specialize to the case α=π/2, we obtain the following spectral
decompositionfortheclassicalFouriertransform F.
Corollary 6. For each 0≤k≤3letXkdenote the closed subspace
ofL2(R)spanned by the Hermite functions hk+4m,m≥0, and let Pk:
L2(R)→Xkbetheorthogonalprojection. Then

and thecorrespondingspectraldecompositionfor theunita ryoperator F:

The operator Tabove appears to be a very interesting integral opera-
tor on the Fock space, although we are unable to verify direct ly thatTis
bounded on F2. A natural problem here is to study the spectral proper-
ties of the integral operator Tabove on F2, or equivalently, the fractional
Hilbert transform as an operator on L2(R). Not much seems to be known,

The most fundamental problem in this direction is to charact erize those
ϕ∈F2such that Sϕis bounded on F2. The extra parameter αinSα
ϕdoes
not yield additional difﬁculty, because Sα
ϕis unitarily equivalent to Sϕvia
theFockspaceversionofthefractionalFouriertransform Fα. Infact,ifwe
writeUα=BFαB−1, so thatUαf(z) =f(e−iαz)forf∈F2, thenUαis a
unitaryoperatoron F2and bythesimplechangeofvariables w=e−iαu,
Sα
ϕf(z) =/integraldisplay
Cf(e−iαu)ezeiαuϕ(eiαz−u)dλ(u) =U−αSϕUαf(z).
ThusSα
ϕandSϕareunitarilyequivalentas operatorson F2.
Several non-trivial examples of Sϕwere considered in [13]. It is still an
open questionto characterize the boundedness of Sϕin terms of properties
ofϕ. In this section we will construct additional examples of bo unded
operators SϕonF2. Our construction is based on the wavelet transform as
an operatoron L2(R).
Fixg∈L2(R)ands∈Rwiths/ne}ationslash= 0, the continuous wavelet transform

Rf(t)g(s−1(t−x))dt, f ∈L2(R).
Itis wellknownthattheFouriertransform of Wg(f)is givenby
|s|1/2F(g)(sx)F(f)(x).
See [8] for more information about the wavelet transform. So the corre-
spondingoperatorontheFock spaceisdeﬁned by

whereDs:L2(R)→L2(R)is thedilationoperatordeﬁned by

First, for any nonnegativeinteger n, letgnbe themonomial xntimes the

It follows that the operator Sϕinduced by ϕ(z) =ea(z−b)2∈F2, where

It is natural to wonder whether Corollary 11 might suggest a c haracteri-

Abstract
Inthe present paper, theauthors introduce several new inte gral transforms inclu-
ding theLn-transform, the L2n-transform and P2n-transform generalizations of the
classical Laplace transform and the classical Stieltjes tr ansform as respectively. It is
shown that the second iterate of the L2n-transform is essentially the P2n-transform.
Using this relationship, a few new Parseval-Goldstein type identities are obtained.
Thetheoremandthelemmasthatareproveninthisarticleare newusefulrelationsfor
evaluating inﬁnite integrals of special functions. Some re lated illustrative examples
arealso given.

transforms, Widder potential transforms, Stieltjes trans forms, Parseval-Goldstein type

Abstract —Despite the exciting performance, Transformer is
criticized for its excessive parameters and computation cost.
However, compressing Transformer remains as an open problem
due to its internal complexity of the layer designs, i.e.,Multi-
Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN). To
address this issue, we introduce Group-wise Transformation to-
wards a universal yet lightweight Transformer for vision-and-
language tasks, termed as LW-Transformer1. LW-Transformer
applies Group-wise Transformation to reduce both the param-
eters and computations of Transformer, while also preserving
its two main properties, i.e., the efﬁcient attention modeling on
diverse subspaces of MHA, and the expanding-scaling feature
transformation of FFN. We apply LW-Transformer to a set of
Transformer-based networks, and quantitatively measure them
on three vision-and-language tasks and six benchmark datasets.
Experimental results show that while saving a large number of
parameters and computations, LW-Transformer achieves very
competitive performance against the original Transformer net-
works for vision-and-language tasks. To examine the generaliza-
tion ability, we also apply our optimization strategy to a recently
proposed image Transformer called Swin-Transformer for image
classiﬁcation, where the effectiveness can be also conﬁrmed.

I. I NTRODUCTION
TRANSFORMER [1] has become the model of choice in
the ﬁeld of natural language processing due to its superior
capability of modeling long-range dependencies and learning
effective representations. Its great success has also attracted
the attention of the computer vision community [2]–[5]. At
present, Transformer and its variants have been applied to a
variety of vision-and-language tasks, such as visual question
answering (VQA) [2], [6], [7], image captioning [3], [8]–
[10], and referring expression comprehension [4], [11], achiev-
ing dominant performance in multiple benchmarks. Besides,
Transformer also yields a new trend of large-scale multi-modal
pretraining [12]–[21], which greatly promotes the development
of joint vision-and-language learning.
Coming with the outstanding ability of long-distance depen-
dency modeling, Transformer-based models are also known

1Source codes are released https://github.com/luogen1996/LWTransformer.for their extreme demand on computation power and memory
space. Such an issue will become more prominent when
applying Transformer to vision-and-language tasks, where
the multi-modal network is typically built based on a large
visual backbone, e.g., ResNet [22] or Faster R-CNN [23]. For
instance, VL-BERT-large [18] needs to be trained on 8 GPUs
in parallel for nearly 20 days, and its parameters are about
340 millions, which takes about 1.2 GB of memory to deploy.
Thus, the large latency and memory footprint greatly hinder
the application of Transformer on the mobile devices.
To this end, the network compression for Transformer-based
models has attracted signiﬁcant research attention [24]–[28].
Popular directions include distillation [25], [27], layer prun-
ing[24] and quantization [26], [28]. Beyond these method-
ologies, one orthogonal direction is to directly optimize the
Transformer layer itself [29]–[31], which has not been paid
enough attention and is the focus of this paper. By designing
a more efﬁcient version of Transformer that still preserves the
accuracy, one can directly train a model based on the improved
structure to avoid the training-distilling process [32], which
can be also combined with the popular compression methods
to further improve their efﬁciency.
However, designing an efﬁcient Transformer remains as
a challenging problem, mainly due to the unique structures
of the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and the Feed-Forward
Network (FFN). First, as a key component in Transformer,
MHA is used to capture the dependency of input features in
various subspaces, upon which efﬁcient feature transforma-
tions can be obtained [1]. In this case, these transformations
in MHA not only map features to new semantic spaces but
also compute the attention scores using the softmax function.
Second, as a layer-to-layer connection design, FFN achieves
efﬁcient transformations by expanding and scaling the feature
dimensions, which inevitably involves a large number of
parameters. Both designs pose a huge obstacle in reducing
Transformer parameters.
In this paper, we introduce Group-wise Transformation to
achieve a lightweight Transformer for vision-and-language
tasks, termed LW-Transformer , which well addresses the afore-
mentioned issues in a principled way. Group-wise Transforma-
tion is an efﬁcient method used in many convolution neural
networks (CNNs) [33]–[38]. It splits the input features into k
groups by channels to perform parameterized transformations,
and then concatenates the transformed features as the output.
This group-wise operation can reduce the parameters and
computations of the original transformation byk 1
k. Based on
this strategy, we propose the group-wise multi-head attentionarXiv:2204.07780v1  [cs.CV]  16 Apr 2022

(G-MHA) and group-wise feed forward networks (G-FFN) for
LW-Transformer.
Notably, in addition to improve model compactness, LW-
Transformer can well maintain the desired principles of the
original Transformer. The effectiveness of Transformer mainly
lies in its MHA design [1], which captures the diverse fea-
ture dependencies through different feature subspaces. These
subspaces are obtained by truncating the input features after
linear projections, as shown in Fig. 1. The principle of Group-
wise transformation is essentially consistent with that of MHA,
which also aims to learn more efﬁcient feature representations
through more diverse feature spaces. In this case, the proposed
G-MHA takes a step forward than MHA, which directly
splits input features before projections. More importantly, this
operation does not change neither the feature dimension nor
the scaled-dot product for attention modeling. Meanwhile, G-
FFN also maintains the expanding-scaling property of FFN
while reducing the computation and parameters to a large
extent, as shown in Fig. 1.
During experiments, we build LW-Transformer based on the
structures of the default Transformer and its variants, including
MCAN [2], LXMERT [19] and Swin-Transformer [39], and
conduct extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, i.e.,
GQA [40], VQA2.0 [41], CLEVR [42], COCO [43], Ref-
COCO [44], RefCOCO+ [44], of three language-and-vision
tasks, i.e., VQA [41], image captioning [43] and referring
expression comprehension (REC) [45]. We also test LW-
Transformer on the large-scale and BERT-style pretrain-
ing [19] and the task of image classiﬁcation. The experimental
results show that with an overall reduction of up to 45%
of parameters and 28% of computations2, LW-Transformer
still achieves competitive performance against the default
Transformer on six benchmark datasets of the three VL tasks
and even obtains performance gains on some benchmarks, e.g.,
+1% on GQA, +0.1% on COCO Captioning and +3.2% on
RefCOCO, which well conﬁrms its effectiveness for vision-

also well validated on ImageNet and CIFAR-100. Compared
with Swin-Transformer, LW-Transformer can obtain the same
performance on CIFAR-100 while saving 42.4% computations
and 43.3% parameters. On ImageNet, LW-Transformer can
even obtain better performance with similar experimental cost
to Swin-Transformer.
As a summary, our contributions are three-fold:
We present the ﬁrst application of Group-wise transfor-
mation to Transformer, and propose an efﬁcient Trans-
former network called LW-Transformer.
On six benchmarks of three language-and-vision tasks,
LW-Transoformer achieves competitive performance
against the default Transformers with a reduction of up to
45% parameters and 28% computations. Its generalization
ability is also validated on the recently proposed Swin-
Transformer [39] for image classiﬁcation.
We conduct extensive experiments to examine the opti-
mizations of different designs in Transformer, which can
provide useful insights for its future optimization.
II. R ELATED WORK
Due to the superior capability of learning efﬁcient represen-
tations, Transformer [1] is becoming popular in both natural
language processing [1], [29], [46], [47] and computer vi-
sion [2], [3], [6]–[10]. A set of Transformer-based approaches
have been proposed to achieve the state-of-the-art performance
in VQA [2], [6], [7], [48] and image captioning [3], [9], [10],
[49]–[53]. For example, the recent X-Linear Transformer [49]
integrates bilinear pooling [54] and squeeze-excitation mod-
ule [55] into self-attention to selectively capitalize on visual
information and to perform multimodal reasoning. With these
novel designs, X-Linear Transformer improves the SOTA
performance of image captioning on the CIDEr [56] metric by
+1.6. Meanwhile, these Transformer-based networks also lead
to a trend of large-scale language-and-vision pre-training [14]–
[19], [21], [57], which break the best performance of various
JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 3
tasks, such as Visual Question Answering [58] and Image
Captioning [43]. In addition, a lot of vision transformers [39],
[59] have been proposed recently, which shows the superior
performance on image classiﬁcation. For example, XCiT [59]
achieves 86.0 % top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming
conventional CNNs by a large margin. Despite the great
success, Transformer and its variants have been criticized for
the excessive parameters and high computation overhead. For
instance, the parameter sizes of BERT [13], ViLBERT [16]
and LXMERT [19] are 85, 221 and 181 millions, respectively.
Such a large amount of parameters greatly hinder the appli-
cations of Transformer and Transformer-based models on the
mobile applications, where both the storage and computation
resources are limited.
Several recent advances [29]–[31] are committed to de-
sign the efﬁcient Transformer networks. Speciﬁcally, Lin-
former [31] reduces the computation cost of self-attention
by compressing the sequence length of input features. Per-
former [30] applies the scalable kernel methods to approx-
imate the scale-dot product attention to reduce computation
overhead when the sequence length is very large. Tensorized
Transformer [29] uses tensor decomposition to reduce the
parameters of Q, K and V in self-attention. Compared with
these efﬁcient Transformers, the proposed LW-Transformer
neither changes the length of input sequences nor the deﬁnition
of attention modeling.
The principle of the introduced Group-wise Transformation
is also related to the group convolution , which can be traced
back to a set of classical convolutional neural networks [33]–
[38], [60] like AlexNet [34]. The depth-wise separable convo-
lution in Xception [33] generalized the method into Inception
Networks [36], [37]. ShufﬂeNets [38] and MobileNets [35],
[60] use the group-wise and depth-wise separable convolution
to achieve lightweight deep networks with competitive per-
formance. However, due to the huge difference between the
principles of multi-head self-attention (MHA) and convolution,
its application to Transformer networks is still left unexploited.
Except for improving model efﬁciency, the motivation of this
paper is different from the mentioned CNNs. Existing methods
like Xception [33] use group-wise transformation to realize the
multi-branch structure, so as to increase the capacity of the
model. In contrast, our application is to inherit the property
of global dependency in self-attention, as discussed in the
introduction.
III. A PPROACH
In this section, we ﬁrst recap the main components of
Transformer, introduce Group-wise Transformation, and then
describe the proposed LW-Transformer in detail.
A. Preliminary
In Transformer, each layer typically contains two main com-
ponents, i.e., Multi-Head Attentions (MHA) for dependency
modeling and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) for position-wise
transformations.
Multi-Head Attention is used to capture the dependency
between input features by the scaled dot-product attention [1],upon which efﬁcient representations are learned. Speciﬁcally,
given the transformed matrices of queryQ2Rnd,key
K2Rnd;and valueV2Rnd, the scaled dot-product
attention function is formulated as:
Attention (Q;K;V) =Softmax (KTQp
d)V: (1)
Here,nandddenote the sequential length and the feature
depth, respectively. To further improve the representational
ability, Vaswani et al. [1] extends Eq. 1 to a multi-head version,
denoted as multi-head attention (MHA), which consists h
paralleled “heads” to make the scale dot-product attention.
Speciﬁcally, given the input features X2Rnd, MHA is
formulated as:
MHA (X) = [head 1;:::;head h];
wherehead i=Attention (Qi;Ki;Vi):(2)
Here,Qi,KiandViare the split features for the i-th head,
and they are obtained by truncating the input features X after
projection. Meanwhile, a linear-merge projection is used after
MHA, deﬁned as:
O=MHA (X)WO; (3)
whereWO2Rddis the weight matrix and O2Rndis
the ﬁnal output.
Feed-Forward Network makes a position-wise and dense
transformation from the input features to the output ones,
which keeps the non-linearity by expanding the hidden units
in the ReLU layer, as shown in Fig. 1 (c). This design is
beneﬁcial to prevent manifold collapse caused by ReLU , as
well as to extend the model capacity [35]. The formulation of
FFN can be written as
FFN(X) =max(0;XW 1+b1)W2+b2: (4)
Here W12Rddf,W22Rdfd,b12Rdfandb22Rdare
weights and bias, and max ()is the ReLU activation. Typically,
dfis a quadruple as large as d.
B. Lightweight Transformer
To achieve the lightweight Transformer, we optimize its two
main designs, i.e., MHA and FFN, with Group-wise transfor-
mation . In this subsection, we begin with the introduction of
Group-wise transformation, and then describe its deployment
on MHA and FFN in detail.
Group-wise transformation. As shown in Fig. 1, given the
input features X2Rnd, we ﬁrst divide it into kgroups.
Those features of different groups are transformed by the func-
tion()and then concatenated again as one complete output.
The formulation of Group-wise Transformation, denoted as
Group (), is deﬁned by
Group (X) = [X0
1;:::;X0
k];
where X0
i=(Xi;):(5)
Here,Xi2Rnd
kdenotes the truncated features of the
i-th group, []denotes concatenation and ()can be any
parameterized function, e.g., linear/ non-linear projections or
more complex modules like self-attention [1].

With the split-transform-concatenate design, the Group-
wise Transformation can savek 1
kof parameters andk 1
kof
the computations. To further reduce the number of parameters,
we can also share the learnable weights for each group,
consistently resulting ink2 1
k2reductions of parameters.
Group-wise Multi-Head Attention. Speciﬁcally, we extend
the original Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in Transformer to a
group-wise version (G-MHA), as shown in Fig. 1 (a).
As described in Sec. III-A, MHA obtains the multiple
attentions via truncating Q, K and V after the projection of
X. In this case, G-MHA can be considered as its extension
in principle, which directly splits the input features before
projection. Concretely, the input features X2Rndare ﬁrst
divided into ksplitsXi2Rnd=k, based on which the multi-
head attentions are performed. Afterwards, those attention
outputs are concatenated again. Then, G-MHA is deﬁned as:
G-MHA (X) = [(X1);:::; (Xk)];
where(Xi) =MHA (Xi):(6)
As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the group operation of G-MHA is
conducted on the feature dimension instead of the sequence
length. Therefore, each feature can still obtain its coupling
coefﬁcients to the others through the comparisons on the
truncated features, similar to the default MHA. To this end,
the attention patterns learned by G-MHA can be close to that
of MHA in principle.
Notably, we do not replace the linear-merge layer in MHA,
i.e.,Woin Eq.2, which is founded to be important for expand-
ing the learning capacity of Transformer and facilitating the
cross-group information exchange. Overall, G-MHA reduces
the parameter size from 4d2to about 2d2, and the computa-
tional complexity from O (4nd2+n2d)to about O (nd2+n2d).
Group-wise Feed-Forward Network. We further deploy
Group-wise Transformation to FFN, of which implementa-
tion is illustrated in Fig. 1 (b). Speciﬁcally, given an input
X2Rnd, the group-wise feed-forward network (G-FFN)
performs non-linear projections to expand the feature size by
H=max(0;XW 1+b1); (7)
whereW12Rddfandb12Rdf. Then, the obtained
hidden features H2Rndfare divided into k independent
features Hi2Rndf
k, which is further linearly transformed
with sharable weights. G-FFN can be formulated as:
G-FFN (X) = [(H1);:::; (Hk)];
where(Hi) =HiW2+b2;(8)
whereW22Rdf
kd
kandb22Rd
k. Compared to the original
FFN, G-FFN reduces the parameter size from O( d2) to O(d2
k2)
and the complexity from O( nd2) to O(nd2
k).
As shown in Eq. 8 and Fig. 1 (b), G-FFN can still maintains
the expanding-scaling property of the default FFN. Notably,
the group-wise operation is only deployed on the last linear
layer, while the ﬁrst non-linear projection remains intact. To
explain, this design is beneﬁcial to protect the non-linearity of
FFN and prevent the manifold collapse [35], therefore avoiding
the performance degeneration.TABLE I: Notations for different settings of LW-Transformer.

IV. E XPERIMENTS
To validate the proposed LW-Transformer, we apply it to a
set of Transformer and BERT-style models, and conduct exten-
sive experiments on six benchmark datasets, i.e.,VQA2.0 [41],
GQA [40], CLEVR [42], MS-COCO [43], RefCOCO [44], Re-
fCOCO+ [44], of three vision-and-language tasks, i.e., Visual
Question Answering (VQA) [58], Image Captioning (IC) [43]
and Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) [45]. To
examine its generalization ability, we build LW-Transformer
based on the newly proposed Swin-Transformer [39] for image
classiﬁcation.
A. Deployed Networks
Transformer : For VQA, IC and REC, we use the Transformer
networks proposed in [1], [2] as our baseline model, which
all follow a classical encoder-decoder structure [1]. In the
baseline, we set the d,df,dhdeﬁned in Eq.1 - 2, as 512, 2,048,
64, respectively. The number of attention heads his 8 for each
Transformer layer, and both the encoder and decoder branches
are composed of six Transformer layers. For simplicity, we de-
note the baseline network as Transformer . We further replace
Transformer with the proposed LW-Transformer layers, and
keep the rest designs unchanged. We denote the compressed
network as LW-Transformer . In LW-Transformer, the basic
settings ofd,df,dhare the same as Transformer. The number
of groups is set to 2 by default, and each group has 4 attention
heads, so the total number of attentions is kept as 8 as
Transformer.
Bert-style Model : The deployed Bert-style model is the
recently proposed LXMERT [19], of which structure is slightly
different from the conventional Transformer network. It has
9 and 6 Transformer encoder layers for the language and
vision modelings, respectively, and 5 cross-modal Transformer
layers3for the multi-modal interactions. During experiments,
we replace the encoder and decoder Transformer layers with
the proposed LW-Transformer layer. The model settings are
similar to the standard bert [13], i.e.,d=768,df= 3156 ,
dh= 96 ,k= 2,h= 6. For simplicity, we denote the network
with our optimization methods as LW-LXMERT . The detailed
explanation of the notations is given in Tab. I.
During experiments, we also examine the sensitivity in
mapping dimensions of query Qand key Ktowards the
model performance. Hence, we add an sufﬁx nafter LW-
Transformer to indicate the change in attention dimensions of
3Cross-modal Transformer layer has two MHA and FFN.

QandK. For instance, dhof LW-Transformer 1is 64, while
the one of LW-Transformer 3is 192.
Swin-Transformer : For image classiﬁcation, we use Swin-
Transformer-tiny [39] as our baseline structure. Swin-
Transformer-tiny is a hierarchical Transformer, which contains
12 Transformer blocks in 4 stages. During experiments, we
simply replace the MHA and FFN of the original Swin-
Transformer-tiny with our G-MHA and G-FFN. The modiﬁed
model is denoted as LW-Transformer. To compare with the
original Swin-Transformer under the same parameters, we also
build a large model containing 16 Transformer blocks, namely
LW-Transformer-large. Meanwhile, we remove weight-sharing
in our model, since we ﬁnd that it degrades the performance
of image classiﬁcation.
B. Datasets
Visual Question Answering : We conduct experiments on
three vqa benchmark datasets, i.e.,VQA2.0 [41], GQA [40]
and CLEVR [42]. VQA2.0 contains about 1.1M image-
question pairs from real word, in which there are 440K
examples for training, 210K for validation, and 450K for
testing. CLEVR is a synthetically generated dataset that aims
to test the visual reasoning ability of models. It includes 700K
and 150K examples for training and test, respectively. GQA
contains 22M questions over 140K images, which is designed
to test the visual reasoning ability of models in real scenes. In
terms of the evaluation metric, we use the VQA accuracy [58]
for VQA2.0, and the classiﬁcation accuracy for GQA and
CLEVR.
Referring Expression Comprehension : RefCOCO [45] and
RefCOCO+ [45] datasets are used in our experiments. Both
datasets contain nearly 140K referring expressions for 50K
bounding boxes of 20K images. The categories of TestA are
about people and the ones of TestB are about objects. Ref-
COCO has more descriptions related to the spatial relations,
while RefCOCO+ excludes these spatial-related expressions
and adds more appearance-related ones. Following [61]–[68],
we use the top-1 accuracy as the metric on both datasets.
Image Captioning : COCO Captioning [43] contains more
than 120K images from MS-COCO [43], each of which is
annotated with 5 different captions. We train and test our mod-
els with the Karpathy splits [69]. BLEU [70], METEOR [71],
ROUGE [72], CIDEr [56] and SPICE [73] are used as the
metrics for evaluation.
Image Classiﬁcation : ImageNet-1K [74] is the most widely-
used benchmark for image classiﬁcation, which contains
1.28M training images and 50K validation images from 1,000
classes. Cifar-100 [75] is a benchmark containing 60,000 low-
resolution images from 100 classes. In Cifar-100, there are
50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for validation.
C. Experiment Setups
Transformer : For all datasets except CLEVR [42], we use the
regional features from [81] as the visual inputs. On VQA2.0,
3The parameters of the language and vision encoders, i.e., CNN and LSTM,
are not counted.GQA and IC, all networks are trained for 13 epochs, 3 of
which are for warming-up. The basic learning rate is set to 1e-
4p
k, wherekdenotes the number of groups, and decayed on
10 epochs and 12 epochs with a factor of 0.2. For CLEVR, we
follow the previous works [42], [82]–[85] to use grid features
extracted by ResNet101 [22]. The model is trained for up to
16 epochs and warmed up for 3 epochs. The basic learning
rate is set to 4e-4p
kand decayed by 0.2 on 13 epochs and
15 epochs. For IC, another 17 training epochs is further used
for the CIDEr-D [51], [56] optimization with a learning rate of
5e-6. The Adam optimizer [86] is used to train all networks.
Bert-style Model : Following the settings of LXMERT [19],
the visual features are extracted by Faster R-CNN [23]
with ResNet101 [22] backbone pretrained on the Visual
Genome [87]. The training procedures are divide into two
steps, i.e., pretraining and ﬁnetune. We follow the default
setting of LXMERT to pre-train the model. The pretraining
takes 20 epochs overall, where the optimizer is Adam [86]
with a initial learning rate of 1e-4 p
k. We then ﬁnetune the
model on VQA and GQA with a learning rate of 1e-5 p
k
for 5 epochs.
Swin-Transformer : Following the default settings of Swin-
Transformer [39], we use the AdamW optimizer with an initial
learning rate of 0.001 and a weight decay of 0.05. We use
a cosine decay learning rate scheduler with 20 epochs of
linear warm-up. Models are trained for total 300 epochs with
1024 batchsize. For ImageNet and Cifar-100, we adopt the
input image resolution of 224224. Following the training
strategy of Swin-Transformer, a set of data augmentations, i.e.,
RandAugment, Mixup, Cutmix, random erasing and stochastic
depth, are applied to avoid overﬁtting.
D. Experiment Results
1) Ablation Study: We ﬁrst examine different designs of
the proposed LW-Transformer including group-wise multi-
head attention (G-MHA), group-wise feed-forward network
(G-FFN) and weight sharing (WS), and also evaluate the
sensitivity of hyper-parameters like the group number ( k) and
the dimensions of query andkeyin MHA (indicated by the
subﬁxnafter LW-Transformer, i.e.,dhdeﬁned in Eq. 2).
The results are reported in Tab. II.
The effect of group-wise transformation. The second
block of Tab. II illustrates the impact of G-MHA, G-FFN
and WS on the parameter size, computation cost and over-
all performance of LW-Transformer. From these results we
can see that while greatly reducing the model parameters
and computations, each of these designs will hardly reduce
model performance, and even help the model obtain slightly
improvements on COCO and RefCOCO. In addition, after
deploying all designs, i.e.,LW-Transformer 1, the parameters
and computations are reduced by 45.5% and 28.3%, respec-
tively. However, the performance drop is still very marginal,
e.g., -0.1% on VQA2.0, -0.08% on COCO and -0.12% on
RefCOCO. Thus, we can conclude that group-wise designs
in LW-Transformer can effectively reduce both parameter size
and computation cost, while maintaining the performance.

ofquery and keyin MHA, of which results are given in
the third block of Tab.II. Here, the sufﬁxes, i.e., 1and
3, indicate the multipliers of dimension expansion. From
these results, we observe that expanding the MHA dimen-
sion further improve the model performance, which helps
LW-Transformer outperform the original Transformer on all
datasets with much fewer parameters. For instance, compared
with LW-Transformer 1, the efﬁciency of LW-Transformer 2
is relatively less signiﬁcant, but it still reduce 40% parameters
and 16.3% computations, respectively. More importantly, it
has almost the same performance to the default Transformer.
We also notice that the increased parameter size is still small,
e.g., +4.7M for 3. In contrast, expanding the projection di-
mensions signiﬁcantly increases the model size in the original
MHA, e.g., +18.8M for 3. To explain, the input features in G-
MHA are ﬁrst truncated into multiple groups, which will leads
to less parameters than the direct projection. This observation
also conﬁrms another merit of Group-wise transformation.The impact of group number. Next, we test LW-
Transformer with different group numbers ( k), as reported
in the last block of Tab. II . From this table, we notice
that although increasing the group number further reduces the
model size, the performance degradation becomes relatively
obvious. For this case, our understanding is that both the
attention modeling and feature transformation require a certain
capacity to learn the large-scale language-and-vision data, e.g.,
VQA2.0, and setting too small feature dimensions will be
counterproductive. In addition, since some layers are not in-
cluded in our optimization scheme, e.g., the linear merge layer
in MHA, the lower bound of LW-Transformer’s parameter
size is about 20M. After experiments, we ﬁnd that a trade-
off between the efﬁciency and the performance is k= 2.
2) Fully Group-wise LW-Transformer: In LW-Transformer,
Group-wise transformation is not applied in two inner layers
of Transformer, i.e., linear merge layer of MHA and the
intermediate layer of FFN. In practice, we ﬁnd that these
two layers are important for keeping the model capacity and
facilitating the cross-group information exchange. In Tab. III,
we quantitatively validate the effects of deploying Group-wise
transformation on these two layers, denoted as Group-wise
Linear-Merge Layer (G-LML) and Group-wise Intermediate
Layer (GIL), respectively. From Tab. III, we can see that
when G-LML and G-IL are deployed, the parameters and
computations are further reduced by 29.5% and 19.7%, respec-
tively, but the performance declines are relatively signiﬁcant,
e.g., from 67.10 to 66.36 on VQA and from 116.9 to 114.8
on COCO. To explain, the completely group-wise structure
divides the network into two independent sub-networks with-

out any cross-group information exchange, which ultimately
results in the performance degeneration. Based on these ob-
servations, we therefore keep the linear-merge layer of MHA
and the intermediate layer of FFN intact in LW-Transformer.
In addition, we also notice that retaining G-IL is the best
choice after the design introduced in the paper, where both
compactness and performance are satisfactory. Therefore, we
further extend LW-Transformer to a mini version, i.e., deploy-
ing G-IL and keeping the linear-merge layer intact for cross-
group information exchange, termed as LW-Transformermini
and compare it with the existing multi-modal fusion net-
works [54], [76]–[80], of which results are shown in Tab. IV.
From Tab. IV, we ﬁnd that even compared to state-of-the-art
methods, i.e.,BLOCK [80], LW-Transformermini
1outperforms
it by a large margin, while the number of parameters is much
smaller, i.e., 14.5M vs18M. Such results greatly support
the effectiveness of LW-Transformer under the extremely
lightweight settings. Meanwhile, it also suggests that the liner
merge layer (LML) is an important design in MHA, which
needs to be carefully considered during optimization.3) Comparisons with other Efﬁcient Transformers: In
Tab. V, we also compare LW-Transformer with existing ef-
ﬁcient transformers including Tensorized Transformer [29],
Performer [30] and Linformer [31]. In Tab. V, Tensorized
Transformer applies Tucker Decomposition , a popular method
in network compression [29], to decompose the projection
weights in MHA. Performer [30] approximates the scaled-
dot product attention by using scalable kernel methods. Lin-
former [31] uses additional projection layers to reduce the
length of the input sequence, which is hard to apply to
apply to the sequence-to-sequence generation tasks like Image
Captioning. So, we only report the results of Linformer on
VQA2.0 and RefCOCO.
From Tab. V, we can see that LW-Transformer obtains better
performance than the other compressing methods, and its per-
formance gains are very distinct on VQA2.0. For these results,
our understanding is that changing the original deﬁnition of
self-attention will affect the effectiveness of Transformer to
some degree. For instance, Linformer reduces the length of
the features for attention, which inevitably leads to the loss of
information for ﬁne-grained tasks like VQA. The performance

of Performer also suggests that there is still a gap between the
approximated attention and the default one.
Secondly, compared with the original structure, Performer
and Tensorized Transformer greatly increases the computation
cost (+30% and +43.8%), while our methods can reduce it
by up to 28.3%. The merit of Linformer in computation
is also very limited. To explain, Linformer and Performer
are proposed for the tasks with very large input sequences,
e.g., language modeling [90] and unidirectional/causal mod-
eling [91]. In unidirectional/causal modeling, the sequence
length of input features can be up to 12,288, so the com-
putation reductions by Linformer and Performer can be up
to 68.8% and 41.3%, respectively. In contrast, the sequence
length for VL tasks typically ranges from 30 to 100 [41],
[43], [45], which are much smaller. Therefore, these efﬁcienttransformer will increase the amount of computations for VL
tasks in contrast.
From these observations, we can conclude that the efﬁciency
of LW-Transformer is indeed obvious, especially considering
its performance gains to other optimization methods. More
importantly, it can improve the efﬁciency of Transformer while
maintaining the original deﬁnition of attention modeling.
4) Comparisons with the State-of-the-art Methods: We
further compare LW-Transformer with SOTA methods on six
benchmark datasets of three multi-modal tasks, i.e., VQA, IC
and REC. The results are given in Tab. VI - VIII.
Tab. VI shows the comparison on three widely-used bench-
mark datasets of VQA, i.e., VQA2.0 [41], CLEVR [42]
and GQA [40]. The ﬁrst observation from this table is that
the performance of the proposed LW-Transformer is very
competitive on all three datasets. And it achieves new SOTA
performance on GQA, which is the largest VQA dataset for
visual reasoning. Besides, compared to these SOTA methods,
LW-Transformer has an obvious advantage in terms of the
parameter size. For instance, BAN-8 and MCAN have 93.4
and 44.1 millions of parameters3, respectively, while LW-
Transformer 1and LW-Transformer 3only have 24.0 and
28.7 millions of parameters, respectively. In addition, we
observe that LW-Transformer achieves better performance than
Transformer except for VQA2.0, which has a strong language
bias and requires a larger parameter size to accommodate the
data distribution [41]. These observations greatly conﬁrm the
JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 9
effectiveness of LW-Transformer and the introduced Group-
wise Transformation on the VQA task.
On REC, which is a task of exploring language-vision
alignment, the advantages of LW-Transformer are more sig-
niﬁcant, as shown in Tab. VII . Compare to SOTA methods
like NMTree [63], the performance gains of LW-Transformer
are up to 6.1% (on RefCOCO+), greatly showing the gen-
eralization ability of LW-Transformer. We also observe that
its performance is very close to that of Transformer, and
even slightly better on RefCOCO, which once again conﬁrms
our argument that Group-wise transformation can compress
Transformer while still keeping its performance.
The comparison on the language-and-vision generative task,
i.e., IC, is given in Tab. VIII . As shown in this table, LW-
Transformer is an excellent generative model. Its performance
is very close toM2Transformer, and even better on the
metrics of CIDEr and SPICE. In addition, the parameter size
of LW-Transformer is smaller than that of M2Transformer,
i.e., 24 millions vs33 millions. Considering M2 Transformer
is already an efﬁcient model, these improvements greatly
suggest the effectiveness and efﬁciency of LW-Transformer.
When compared to the SOTA method, i.e., X-Transformer,
the advantage of LW-Transformer in efﬁciency becomes more
prominent. Compared with X-Transformer, LW-Transformer
has up to 79.0% fewer parameters, while the performance is
only reduced by 1.12% on CIDEr.
5) Quantitative Results with the BERT-style Pre-training:
We further apply our optimization strategy to a BERT-style
model, i.e., LXMERT [19], and compare it with a set of
methods pre-trained on the large-scale language-and-vision
data. The result is given in Tab. XI. For simplicity, we denote
the compressed LXMERT as LW-LXMERT. From this table,
we ﬁrst observe that after deploying G-MHA and G-FFN,
the parameter size of LXMERT is reduced by up to 44.8%,
while the performance is marginally reduced on VQA2.0 and
even better on GQA. We notice that compared to some SOTA
methods like 12in1 [17], the performance of LW-LXMERT
on VQA2.0 is slightly worse. As mentioned about, VQA2.0
requires a larger model capacity due to the issue of language
bias [41]. On GQA, examples of which are more balanced
and more challenging, LW-LXMERT achieves new SOTA
performance. Such results conﬁrm again our argument that
LW-Transformer can be applied to most Transformer-based
networks, while maintaining their high performance.
6) Results of Image Classiﬁcation: To further examine
the generalization ability of LW-Transformer, we build it on
the recently proposed Swin-Transformer [39] and conduct
additional experiments on the task of image classiﬁcation, of
which results are given in Tab. IX. In this table, we report
three LW-Transformer with different settings. The ﬁrst two are
LW-Transformer 1with different group numbers, and the last
one is LW-Transformer 1-large, which has similar parameter
size as Swin-Transformer by adding more Transformer layers.
From these results, we have some observations. Firstly,
on Cifar-100, LW-Transformer 1hardly degrades the per-
formance of Swin-Transformer. On top-5 accuracy , LW-
Transformer 1even performs slightly better. These results
are consistent with those in vision-and-language benchmarks.Secondly, on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, LW-
Transformer 1is slightly worse than Swin-Transformer. In
this regard, our assumption is that ImageNet has a higher
requirement for model capacity. Considering the saved ex-
perimental expenditure, e.g., saving 40.3% parameters and
42.2% MAdds when group number is 4, the performance
drop (-2.8%) is still acceptable. This assumption is validated
in the results of LW-Transformer-large. It improves Swin-
Transformer on Cifar-100 and ImageNet with similar parame-
ters and computations. Considering Swin-Transformer is care-
fully designed for image classiﬁcation, these slightly improve-
ments well validate the effectiveness of our method. Lastly,
compared with Performer, LW-Transformer 1has all-round
advantages. Retaining better performance, LW-Transformer 1
merits in the parameter size and the computation cost, which
greatly validates our motivation about the application of group-
wise transformation. Overall, these results well support the
generalization ability and efﬁciency of LW-Transformer for the
traditional computer vision tasks.
E. Qualitative Experiment.
To gain deep insights into LW-Transformer, we visualize its
attention maps and compare them with the ones of the default
Transformer in Fig.2.
In Fig. 2 (a), we present the overall patterns of single- and
multi-modal attentions learned by Transformer and the pro-
posed LW-Transformer. From these visualizations, we can see
that the global dependency patterns learned by two networks
are roughly the same, which subsequently conﬁrms the argu-
ment we made in this paper, i.e., group-wise transformation
essentially inherits the principle of self-attention.
In addition to this observation, we capture some subtle
differences between two networks and two multi-modal tasks.
For example, the attention patterns of VQA and REC are
slightly different. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the words indicating
question type will be more important in VQA, e.g., “is the ”
and “ what color ”. In contrast, REC requires the model to
focus more on spatial information like “ left” or “ middle ”.
This result further reﬂects the difference of model reasoning
between two tasks. That is, VQA relies more on the language
prior of question types to answer the question, and REC
locates the target instance based more on spatial information.
Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that these different attention patterns can
be mastered by both LW-Transformer and Transformer.
In terms of vision-and-language alignment, the attention
focus of LW-Transformer is more concentrated, while the one
of Transformer is more divergent. For instance, in the second
example of VQA, Transformer’s attention is ﬂat, mainly
focusing on the incorrect text-image relationships (4-7). In
contrast, the attention of LW-Transformer is more accurate.
These properties is also reﬂected in the visualizations of
cross-modal attentions in Fig.2.b. From the examples of
Fig. 2.b, we can see that LW-Transformer can obtain more
precise “attention” than Transformer. Speciﬁcally, in cross-
modal attention, Transformer and LW-Transformer focus on
similar image regions. However, LW-Transformer will be more
accurate in terms of the most attended regions (with red

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduce the Group-wise Transformation
to achieve a lightweight yet general Transformer network,
termed LW-Transformer . Compressing Transformer still re-
tains challenging mainly due to its complex layer designs,
i.e., MHA and FFN. The proposed LW-Transformer can well
maintain their main principles, i.e., the efﬁcient attention
modelings on diverse subspaces and the expanding and scaling
feature transformation, and reduce the parameter sizes and
computation costs to a large extend. More importantly, the in-
tention of group-wise transformation is consistent with MHA,
which can ensure LW-Transformer to learn similar or even
better attention patterns as the default Transformer. To validate
our optimization strategy, we build LW-Transformer based on
Transformer and a BERT-style model called LXMERT, and
conduct extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets of
three multi-modal tasks. The experimental results show that
while saving up to 45% of parameters and 28% of computationcosts, LW-Transformer can achieve almost or even better
performance than Transformer on these datasets. Meanwhile,
the generalization ability of LW-Transformer is also well
validated on a newly proposed image Transformer called Swin-
Transformer [39] for the task of image classiﬁcation. These
results greatly validate the effectiveness of LW-Transformer
as well as our motivation.

Abstract
Time-frequency transforms represent a signal as a mixture of its
time domain representation and its frequency domain representat ion.
We present eﬃcient algorithms for the quantum Zak transform and
quantum Weyl-Heisenberg transform.
1 Introduction
The Fourier transform is an operator that expresses a time-d ependent sig-
nal as a sum (or integral) of periodic signals. In other words the Fourier
transform changes a function of time s(t) into a function of frequency S(ω).
If a signal is a function of time it said to be in the “time domai n” and
if it is a function of frequency it is said to be in the “frequen cy domain”.
For signals whose spectrum is changing in time, i.e. nonstat ionary signals,
sometimes the best description is a mixture of the time and fr equency com-
ponents. Signal representations which mix the time and freq uency domains
are called, naturally enough, “time-frequency representa tions” and are often
used to describetime-varying signals for which the purefre quency or Fourier
representation is inadequate [2],[3]. A familiar example o f a time-frequency
representation is a musical score, which describes when(time) certain notes
(frequency) are to be played.
Formally speaking for our present purposes, a quantum signa l is sim-
ply a quantum state |ψ/an}bracketri}htwhere the Hilbert space is the group algebra C[G]
of a ﬁnite abelian group G. The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is
central to the important quantum algorithms for factoring a nd discrete log-
arithm. Mathematically speaking, the Quantum Fourier Tran sform is a
linear operator on the Hilbert Space C[G] which is a change of basis from

{|χ1/an}bracketri}ht,|χ2/an}bracketri}ht,...,|χ|G|/an}bracketri}ht}.
We present eﬃcient algorithms for quantum versions of the Za k and
Weyl-Heisenberg transforms. Both these time-frequency tr anforms can be
seen as generalizations of Fourier transforms and the quant um algorithms
make heavy use of the Quantum Fourier Transform. We follow th e theory
and notation of [4] andrecommend this bookas background tot his material.
2 Zak Transforms
2.1 Background
LetAbe a ﬁnite, abelian group, A∗the group of characters of A(note:
in this paper∗doesnotmean conjugation), B≤Aa subgroup of A,
B∗={a∗∈A∗:a∗(b) = 1,b∈B}the dual to B, andf∈C[A], the
group algebra of A. Deﬁne
Z(B)f∈C[A×A∗]
by the formula
Z(B)f(a,a∗) =/summationdisplay
b∈Bf(a+b)a∗(b).
F=Z(B)fis called the Zak transform of foverB. A simple calculation
shows that F(a+b,a∗+b∗) =a∗(b)F(a,a∗) whereb∈Bandb∗∈B∗.
ThereforeFis determined by its values on a set of coset representatives of
B×B∗inA×A∗and thus conceptually we may think of Fas a function
onTwhereTis a set of coset representatives. Since
|A×A∗|
|B×B∗|=|A|2
|B||B∗|=|A|
we have the same number of degrees of freedom with which we sta rted.
Notice that if Bcontains only the identity, i.e. is the trivial subgroup, th en
Z(B)f(a,a∗) =f(a) and is basically the identity map. Also notice that
ifB=AthenZ(A)f(0,a∗) =/an}bracketle{ta∗|f/an}bracketri}htand therefore Z(A)fis basically the
Fourier transform of f. So the Zak transform mediates between the time
domain and frequency domain depending on the subgroup B.
Consider the function f(a0) =δ(x−a0) which is 1 on a0and 0
otherwise. Applying the above formula for the Zak transform yields
F(a,a∗) =a∗(a−a0) fora∈a0+B,a∗∈A∗and 0 otherwise. But since
Fis determined by its values on a set of coset representatives ofB×B∗in
2
A×A∗let us introduce such a set of representatives T=T1×T2={(xi,a∗
j)}
whereT1={xi}is a set of coset representatives of BinAandT2={a∗
j}is
a set of coset representatives of B∗inA∗. Bearing in mind the above trans-
formation of a delta function, we now oﬀer our deﬁnition of the Quantum
Zak Transform (QZT) (with respect to T) by
|a/an}bracketri}ht /ma√sto→1/radicalbig
|B|/summationdisplay
a∗
j∈T2a∗
j(xa−a)|xa/an}bracketri}ht|a∗
j/an}bracketri}ht.
wherexa∈T1is the coset representative of a. Now notice that xa−a∈B.
Thereforea∗
jis restricted to Band therefore can be considered to be a
character of B, i.e. an element of B∗, and this restriction is independent of
the choice of coset representative, i.e. it is naturalorcanonical . Therefore
an equivalent formulation of the QZT is given by
|a/an}bracketri}ht /ma√sto→1/radicalbig
|B|/summationdisplay
b∗∈B∗b∗(xa−a)|xa/an}bracketri}ht|b∗/an}bracketri}ht.
The only diﬀerence in these two formulations is in the interpretation of the
observed content of the second register.
2.2 The Quantum Algorithm
We now show that the QZT is eﬃciently implementable. Deﬁne P(B) to be
the transform
P(B)|a/an}bracketri}ht=|xa/an}bracketri}ht|xa−a/an}bracketri}ht
which decomposes ainto its coset representative and the corresponding ele-
mentofB.Pisclearlyunitaryandeﬃcientlyimplementable. Afterappl ying
P(B) we apply the Quantum Fourier Transform (over the group B, denoted
FB) to the second register. This results in the state
1/radicalbig
|B|/summationdisplay
b∗∈B∗b∗(xa−a)|xa/an}bracketri}ht|b∗/an}bracketri}ht.
Therefore the QZT is simply Z(B) = (I⊗FB)◦P(B).
3 Weyl-Heisenberg Transforms
3.1 Background
Deﬁneg(x,x∗)(a) =g(a−x)x∗(a) to be the time-frequency translate of gby
(x,x∗) whereg∈C[A]. We will use time-frequency translates to form
3
orthonormal bases so we also require |g|= 1. Let ∆ = B×B∗and
(g,∆) ={g(x,x∗): (b,b∗)∈∆}.We call (g,∆) aW-H system over ∆with
windowg. A basic result ([4], Theorem 12.1 corrected version) is that ( g,∆)
is an orthonormal basis of C[A] if and only if for all ( a,a∗)∈A×A∗we
have|G(a,a∗)|=/radicalBig
|B|
|A|where the Zak tranform is taken over B. Because
von Neumann measurements must be unitary we will restrict ou r attention
to window functions gwhich satisfy this constraint. Utilizing POVMs one
could consider implementing nonorthonormal W-H systems bu t we will not
address this in this note. This orthogonality constraint to gether with the
earlier observation that Gis determined by its values on a set of coset rep-
resentatives of B×B∗inA×A∗implies that orthonormal W-H systems are
in bijective correspondence with the set of all |A|-tuples of complex num-
bers with modulus/radicalBig
|B|
|A|. In this note we will restrict the W-H systems
under consideration by assuming that for each ( a,a∗)∈A×A∗the phase
ofG(a,a∗) is a rational fraction of 2 πwhich we can compute in polynomial
time. Whether or not this last assumption is excessively res trictive would
depend on the intended application. Notice that if gis the constant function
g=1√
|A|and ∆ = {0}×A∗then (g,∆) is the (normalized) Fourier basis,
G(a,a∗) =1√
|A|and this restriction holds trivially.
We deﬁne the Quantum Weyl-Heisenberg Transform (QWHT) by
|ψ/an}bracketri}ht /ma√sto→/summationdisplay
(b,b∗)∈∆/an}bracketle{tψ|g(b,b∗)/an}bracketri}ht|b,b∗/an}bracketri}ht.
In other words, the QWHT expresses |ψ/an}bracketri}htin the orthonormal basis of time-
frequency translates of the window function.
3.2 The Quantum Algorithm
Let
f=/summationdisplay
(b,b∗)∈∆α(b,b∗)g(b,b∗)
i.e. theα’s are the coeﬃents of the WH-expansion of f. Deﬁne
P(a,a∗) =/summationdisplay
(b,b∗)∈∆α(b,b∗)b∗(a)a∗(b).
Notice that Pis ∆-periodic and that the α’s are, by deﬁnition, the Fourier
coeﬃcents (over A×A∗) ofP. A fundamental result ([4], Theorem 7.5)
4
states that F=GP. This result suggests an algorithm for computing the
WH-coeﬃcients of f, namely compute the Fourier coeﬃcients of P=F
G.
Deﬁne Φ(g) to be the unitary transformation which acts on the Hilbert
spaceC[T] (recallTis the set of coset representatives of B×B∗inA×A∗)
by
|xi/an}bracketri}ht|a∗
j/an}bracketri}ht /ma√sto→1
G(xi,a∗
j)|xi/an}bracketri}ht|a∗
j/an}bracketri}ht.
Since the phase of G(xi,a∗
j) is, by assumption, a rational fraction of 2 π
computable in polynomial time we may eﬃciently implement Φ( g) by the
phase kickback technique described in [1]. Finally in order to complete our
description of the algorithm, we must assume that we are give n an explicit
isomorphism between AandA∗. These groups are isomorphic, though not
canonically so. Therefore in any computational situation w e provide an
explicit isomorphism by choosing an explicit computationa l representation
of the groups AandA∗. This isomorphism induces explicit isomorphisms
betweenBandB∗and between the factor group A/BandB∗. We will see
shortly how we will employ these three interrelated isomorp hisms. We will
highlight this interrelation, and abuse notation, by using the symbol φto
refer to all three of these isomorphisms, allowing for conte xt to make the
usage clear. As in the case of the Zak transformtion, these is omorphisms
are simply reinterpretations of the contents of the registers.
Our QWHT is the sequence FB∗×B◦Φ(g)◦Z(B).Let us see how this
unitary transformation acts on |a/an}bracketri}ht. We have
Z(B)|a/an}bracketri}ht=1/radicalbig

where we are now considering the contents of the second regis ter to be an

1.Introduction and main results
Two basic problems in mathematics are: when are two objects in a given class
the same, and what are the properties of the typical object in a given class? A
measure-preserving dynamical system is a 4-tuple ( X;M;;T ) whereXis a set,
Mis a-algebra,is a measure on ( X;M) andT:X!Xis anM-measurable
transformation satisfying T=. One notion of \sameness"" in measure preserving
systems is isomorphism: ( X;M;;T ) and (Y;N;;S) are isomorphic if there exists
:X!Y, dened-almost everywhere, and  1:Y!X, dened-almost
everywhere, so that =andS=T 1. A basic problem in ergodic
theory is to nd invariants that distinguish measure preserving systems.
For the second question, since the 1940s, one way this has been interpreted is by
considering the space of measure preserving transformations and calling a property
typical if it holds on a dense G, orresidual , set [4, 6].
Letdenote Lebesgue measure and let
X=fT: [0;1]![0;1]jTis bimeasurable and preserves g=
whereis the relation
(TSifTx=Sxforalmost every x):
Consider the topology generated by
N(T;A; ) =fS2X:(SATA)<g
whereA[0;1) is measurable and  >0. This called the weak topology onX,
and turnsXinto a Polish space. This topology coincides with the L1() topology
restricted toX(which is a closed subset of L1()).
Aninterval exchange transformation (IET) is an invertible piecewise orientation
preserving isometry of the interval, such that the interval is divided into dleft
closed, right open subintervals that are permuted (see Figure 1). Note that if T
is an IET that is continuous on an interval J, it is automatically an (orientation
preserving) isometry on J. Our main result is that the typical measure preserving
transformation is not isomorphic to any IET:
Theorem 1.1.fS2X :there does not exist Tan IET with Sisomorphic to Tg
contains a dense Gset.
We remark that the typical measure preserving system shares many properties
with some (often most or all) IETs. The typical measure preserving system is
weakly mixing but not strongly mixing, rigid, and not simple. There exist many
IETs sharing these properties, so we need dierent invariants to distinguish the
typical measure preserving transformation from all IETs.

IfThas a mixing sequence, it is called weakly mixing , and if Nis a mixing sequence

Halmos proved that a residual subset of Xis weakly mixing [4], and Rokhlin
proved that a residual set of Xis not mixing [6]. It is our understanding that
these two results are historically how people learned that there are weakly mixing
transformations that are not mixing. (For an explicit example, see [2].)
Denition 1.3. Given an increasing function f:N!N, we say that an increasing
sequence of natural numbers a1< a 2< ::: isf-thick if [j;f(j)]faig1

Proposition 1.4. Letfbe any increasing function. Then there exists G, a residual
subset ofX(with the weak topology), so that every element of Ghas anf-thick
mixing sequence.
The next proposition requires a denition: A transformation is minimal if the
orbit of every point is dense.
Proposition 1.5. No minimal IET has a j!jj-thick mixing sequence.
In the language of the introductory paragraphs, certain types of mixing sequences
are invariants that distinguish the typical measure preserving transformation from
all interval exchange transformations.
Proof of Theorem 1.1 assuming Propositions 1.4 and 1.5. Considerf(j) =jj. By
Proposition 1.4, G, a residual set of measure preserving transformations has an
THE TYPICAL MEASURE PRESERVING TRANSFORMATION IS NOT AN IET 3
f-thick mixing sequence. Every non-minimal IET has at least two invariant com-
ponents of positive measure [1, Theorem 2.16]. Letting AandBbe two such
components, the indicator functions of AandBshow thatTcan not have any
mixing sequence. By Proposition 1.5, no minimal IET has an f-thick mixing se-
quence. Clearly isomorphic transformations have the same mixing sequences, and
so no measure preserving transformation in Gis isomorphic to any IET. 
2.Proof of Proposition 1.4
Proving that a property is typical in the space of measure preserving transfor-
mations has a standard strategy: First, one shows that it is a Gproperty. This
often comes from studying approximating conditions which are open. Second, one
shows that there exists an aperiodic transformation satisfying the property, and
quotes the following result of Halmos:
Lemma 2.1. [4, Theorem 1] The conjugacy class of any aperiodic transformation
inXis dense inX.
We now follow the strategy outlined above.
Lemma 2.2. For any increasing function f, the subset ofXthat has an f-thick
mixing sequence is a Gset.
The proof uses some straightforward facts that we leave as an exercise:
(i) ForA;B measurable and n2Z, the function dened by  A;B;n:X!C
by A;B;n(T) =(T nA\B) is continuous.
(ii) For any j;k2Nand>0, the set
UA;B;j;k() :=fT2X:j(T nA\B) (A)(B)j<for alljnkg
is open.
(iii)(T niA\B) (A)(B)!0 for all measurable sets A;B i(T niI\
J) (I)(J) for all dyadic intervals I;J.
Proof of Lemma 2.2. LetD1;:::be an enumeration of the (countable) set of dyadic
intervals. The subset of elements of Xthat havef-thick mixing sequences is
1\
m=11\
n=11\
b=11[
j=b\
k;`<mUDk;D`;j;f(j)1
n
:
This is by construction a countable intersection of open sets and therefore is a G
set. 
Proof of Proposition 1.4. By the previous two lemmas it suces to show that there
exists an aperiodic measure preserving transformation with an f-thick mixing se-
quence. As there are mixing transformations, (and Nisf-thick for any f) there
existsT2X so thatThas anf-thick mixing sequence for all increasing f.
3.Proof of Proposition 1.5
To prove Proposition 1.5, which requires showing that certain sequences can
not be mixing sequences for IETs, we take advantage of a behavior at the opposite
extreme of mixing sequences: rigidity sequences. We say n1;:::is arigidity sequence
forTifTniconverges (in L1) to the identity. Surprisingly, the typical measure
preserving transformation not only has a mixing sequence, but it also has a rigidity
4 JON CHAIKA AND DIANA DAVIS
sequence, which necessarily intersects its mixing sequence in at most a nite set.
We will use a mild generalization of rigidity sequences, partial rigidity sequences , to
prove Proposition 1.5. (Some IETs do not have rigidity sequences, let alone large
enough rigidity sequences to rule out f-thick mixing sequences.)
We say that n1;:::is ac-partial rigidity sequence if there exist measurable sets
A1;:::so that(Ai)>cfor alliand lim
j!1sup
x2Ajd(Tnjx;x) = 0.
Lemma 3.1. To prove Proposition 1.5, it suces to prove that for each minimal
IET,T, there exists an integer r>1, a real number c>0, and a sequence n1;::::;
so thatni+1<rnifor alli, andn1<::: is ac-partial rigidity sequence for T.
Proof. To prove the lemma, it suces to show that if n1;:::is ac-partial rigidity
sequence for T, then it cannot be contained in a mixing sequence. We now prove
this. Let 2 k<1

To prove this result we use the Poincar e rst return map , a standard construc-
tion in ergodic theory. Let ( X;M;;S) be a probability measure preserving dy-
namical system and let A2M . Forx2Atherst return time ofxtoAis
nA(x) = minfj >0 :Sjx2Agand by the Poincar e recurrence theorem, [3, Theo-
rem 1,x1.1] this is dened for jAalmost every x. The rst return map ofStoA
isx!SnA(x)xis measurable and jAmeasure preserving [3, x1.5]. In the proof of
Lemma 3.3 we use the following standard result about IETs:
Lemma 3.4. [3, Lemma 2,x5.3]IfTis an IET on dintervals, and Iis an interval,
then the rst return map of TtoIis an IET on at most d+ 2intervals. Moreover,
on each interval the rst return time is constant.
The last claim in the lemma is established in the last two sentences in the proof
of [3, Lemma 2,x5.3]. We sketch the idea of the proof of the lemma. Consider how
Tjcan become discontinuous on a subinterval of I. It must map Ito a discontinuity
ofT. Because we are examining a rst return map, the injectivity of Timplies that
each discontinuity can only cut Ionce before rst return. The endpoints of Ican
also cause discontinuities of the return time function, which can create two more
cuts.
Proof of Lemma 3.3. Consider the rst return map of TtoJ. It consists of at most
d+ 2 intervals, and on each such interval, the return time is constant. Consider the
setSof points whose return time is at most2

We wish to show by induction that for all isatisfying ( i+ 1)k < n , we have
T(i+1)kJ=Tk +TikJ;which will establish the sublemma. To do this we
inductively assume that

(5) Tiky T(i 1)ky=Tk 
for ally2J. The case of i= 1 is above.
We now prove the sublemma by induction. Assume it is true for i=`and that
(`+ 1)k < n . By our assumption, TkJ\J6=;, and soT(`+1)kJ\T`kJ6=;.

So, there exists y2T(`+1)kJ\T`kJ. Sincey2T`kJ, there exists x2Jso that
T`kx=y, and thus

T(`+1)kx x=T(`+1)kx T`kx+ (T`kx x) =Tk +`(Tk )

We now complete the proof of the lemma using the sublemma. Let B=fJ2

Abstract
This comprehensive review paper delves into the intricacies of advanced Fourier type integral transforms and
their mathematical properties, with a particular focus on fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), linear canonical
transform (LCT), quadratic phase Fourier transform (QPFT), and their associated offshoots: windowed Fourier
transform, wavelet transform, and Stockwell transform. In the pursuit of a deeper understanding of these trans-
formations, we explore their convolution properties, shedding light on their capacity to define windowed, wavelet
and Stockwell transforms in the realm of Fourier, fractional Fourier and quadratic phase Fourier transforms. This
review also expands its purview to the realm of uncertainty principles. Several uncertainty principles, like Heisen-
berg, logarithmic, local, R´ enyi uncertainty principles, etc., within the context of fractional Fourier, linear canonical,
and quadratic phase Fourier transforms, as well as their derivative offshoots are presented in the paper both for the
functions of complex as well as quatenrion valued. In particular, the counterpart of several important inequalities
of classical Fourier transform are also presented in details for the quaternion case. This article also reviews that
multiresolution analysis that has been developed in the literature so far.

The Fourier transform (FT) is a spectacular mathematical analysis tool that has long been acknowledged as having
the greatest significance to contemporary science and technology developments. There have been numerous mathe-
matical advances in the field of Fourier analysis over time, which have had major effects on the traditional FT. In
the ever-expanding domain of signal processing and analysis, the quest for deeper insights, finer resolutions, and more
comprehensive interpretations remains unceasing. This review paper embarks on an exploration of advanced signal
transformation techniques that transcend the classical boundaries of the Fourier domain. We delve into the profound
world of signal transformation, examining the Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), Linear Canonical Transform
(LCT), Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform (QPFT), and their derived offshoots: the Windowed Fourier Transform,
Wavelet Transform, and Stockwell Transform. These transforms offer a sophisticated toolkit that transcends the
conventional transforms. The Fractional Fourier Transform, for instance, introduces fractional orders, allowing us to
analyze signals with dynamic and complex frequency content, such as chirp signals and those influenced by dispersion.
The Linear Canonical Transform unifies diverse mathematical transforms into a unified framework, providing a com-
prehensive approach to handling signals with intricate spatiotemporal characteristics. It transcends the limitations
2
of individual transforms, making it a valuable asset in fields as diverse as optics, signal processing, and quantum
mechanics. The most recent edition, and the generalization of all, i.e., Fourier transform, fractional Fourier transform
and the linear canonical transform, the Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform refines our understanding of signals by
focusing on the often-overlooked quadratic phase components. This transformation is indispensable for applications
like radar, sonar, and image processing, where precise characterization of signals with varying phase characteristics is
paramount.
The introduction of the windowed Fourier transform, wavelet transform, and Stockwell transform arises from the
inherent properties of the classical Fourier transform, specifically its use of a global kernel. Because of the global
kernel, Fourier transform fails in giving local properties of signal. To overcome these limitations, the Windowed
Fourier Transform (WFT) was introduced. It incorporates a window function that acts as a localized filter to select
a specific segment of the signal. By applying the Fourier transform to this windowed segment, the WFT allows for
the analysis of signal characteristics within this localized region. This approach provides more detailed and localized
information about the signal’s frequency content. The Wavelet Transform further extends the concept of localized
analysis. Wavelets are a family of functions that are adjustable in scale and position. By using wavelets as the
analysis function, the Wavelet Transform offers both time and frequency localization. It can capture high and low-
frequency components with varying time resolutions, which is particularly useful for understanding transient and
non-stationary features in signals. Meanwhile, the Stockwell transform is designed to address signals with rapidly
changing frequency components. It employs a windowed approach to capture local characteristics of the signal in
the time-frequency domain. The Stockwell Transform, like the WFT and Wavelet Transform, enables a localized
view of the signal’s frequency content, facilitating the analysis of non-stationary signals. The introduction of the
windowed Fourier transform, wavelet transform, and Stockwell transform is driven by the need to go beyond the
global view of the classical Fourier transform. These techniques provide localized analysis, offering a more detailed
and nuanced understanding of signals, particularly those with complex, non-stationary, or transient characteristics.
They are indispensable tools in signal processing, offering the ability to extract specific features from signals in
diverse applications, from image analysis to audio processing. Similar, limitation of the fractional Fourier transform,
linear canonical transform and the quadratic phase Fourier transform as the Fourier transform in the fractional Fourier
domain, linear canonical domain and the quadratic phase Fourier domain, results in the development of their offshoots
as windowed Fourier transform, wavelet transform and the Stockwell transform, in the realm of the fractional Fourier
transform, linear canonical transform and the quadratic phase Fourier transform.
Apart from the function of complex-valued ( C-valued), researchers are also actively involved in studying these
transforms for quaternion-valued ( H-valued) functions. Indeed due to non-commutativity of the quaternion multipli-
cation, extension of the complex Fourier transform to quaternion valued functions can be at least of three different
types, left sided, right sides and the two sided. The non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication has given rise
to distinct variants of quaternion Fourier transform including windowed Fourier transform, wavelet transform, and
the Stockwell transform for the quaternion valued functions. These quaternion-based transforms consider the non-
commutative properties of quaternion algebra and provide unique insights into signals characterized by both magnitude
and phase components. The quaternion Fourier transform extends traditional Fourier analysis to quaternion-valued
signals, offering a unified framework for time-frequency analysis, while windowed quaternion Fourier transforms focus
on localized time-frequency features within quaternion signals. QWTs and the QSTs enable multi-resolution analysis
of quaternion signals, capturing both amplitude and phase information facilitate the study of non-stationary signals
in the quaternion domain. These specialized approaches have found applications in diverse fields, particularly in
multidimensional and multichannel signal analysis, where the traditional Fourier transforms fail in doing so.
This review paper is intended to discuss the important mathematical properties of the fractional Fourier transform,
linear canonical transform, quadratic phase Fourier transform and their associated offshoots: windowed Fourier trans-
form, wavelet transform and Stockwell transform for the functions of complex-valued and and the quaternion-valued.
In what follows, we mention the theme of this review paper point wise.
•This article is devoted to the survey of the convolutions and the corresponding convolution theorem associated
with the fractional Fourier transform, linear canonical transform and the quadratic phase Fourier transform
both for complex and the quaternion-valued functions.
•To survey the convolution based joint time-frequency analysis tools like wavelet transform and the Stockwell
transform in the Fractional Fourier domain, linear canonical domain and the quadratic phase Fourier domain,
both for the complex and the quaternion valued functions.
•Multiresolution analysis (MRA) are the fundamental tools in the construction of a wavelet. Several MRA are
developed in the literature in the last few year, associated with the FrWT and LCWT. This paper collects the
MRA developed so far in the literature.
•Important inequalities like Hausdorff-Young inequality, Pitts inequality are of fundamental importance in Fourier
3
analysis. This review paper is also devoted to survey the counterpart of these inequalities for the FrFT, LCT
and the QPFT, both for the function of complex as well as quaternion valued functions. Also, we survey the
Lieb’s inequality for the v in the content of the FrFT, LCT and the QPFT.
•Several qualitative and quantitative uncertainty principle for the Fourier transform has been explored in the
literature for the functions of complex valued. We survey the Heisenberg, local, logarithmic and R´ enyi (in
particular Shannon) uncertainty principles and their variants for the FrFT, LCT and the QPFT for the complex
and quaternion valued functions.
•We also see the boundedness of the WT, FrWT and the LCWT in the various function spaces like Sobolev space,
Morrey space, BMO space, Hardy space, generalized Sobolev space,etc.
Through this exploration, we aim to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, engineers, and mathematicians
interested in advanced signal processing and analysis. By elucidating the mathematical foundations and properties of
these transforms and the associated uncertainty principles, we endeavor to advance the understanding and application
of these tools in a wide range of scientific and technological domains.
Several sections comprise our survey. Each section is devoted to a single integral transform and its corresponding
essential results. Before we move to the section-wise survey, we recall some basic definitions and results.

In particular, L2(Rn)is a Hilbert space, where the inner product inducing the norm is given by

where g(t)is the conjugate of g(t).
Definition 1.2. LetAbe an arbitrary set and Xbe a Hilbert space of complex valued functions defined on Awith

For any fixed q∈A,we have K(⋅, q)is in Xandf(q)=⟨f(⋅), K(⋅, q)⟩Xfor all f∈X.
2 Quaternion Algebra and some important notions
The field of real and complex numbers are respectively denoted by RandC.Let
H={r=r0+ir1+jr2+kr3∶r0, r1, r2, r3∈R},
where i, jandkare the imaginary units such that they satisfy the following Hamilton’s multiplication rule
ij=k=−ji, jk=i=−kj, ki=j=−ik, i2=j2=k2=1.
4
For a quaternion r=r0+ir1+jr2+kr3,we call r0the real scalar part of r,and denote it by Sc(r).The scalar part
satisfies the following cyclic multiplication symmetry
Sc(pqr)=Sc(qrp)=Sc(rpq),∀p, q, r∈H. (1)
We denote the quaternion conjugate of ras ¯rand is defined as
¯r=r0−ir1−jr2−kr3.
The quaternion conjugate satisfy the following
qr=¯r¯q,q+r=¯q+¯r,¯¯q=q,∀q, r∈H. (2)
The modulus of r∈His defined as
∣r∣=√
r¯r=⎛

, (3)
and it satisfies ∣qr∣=∣q∣∣r∣,∀q, r∈H.
Each quaternion can be split by
q=q++q−, q±=1
2(q±iqj).
By the real components r0, r1, r2, r3∈R,we have
r±={r0±r3+i(r1∓r2)}1±k
2=1±k
2{r0±r3+j(r1∓r2)}, (4)
where q±is orthogonal in in the sense that [r+r−]0=0.It is to be noted that r+andr−lies in the planes spanned by
{i−j,1+ij}and{i+j,1−ij}respectively. These planes are orthogonal which spans the whole quaternion. This leads
to the following modular identity [98]
∣r∣2=∣r+∣2+∣r−∣2. (5)

3 Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT)
For a suitable complex valued function fof real variable we define the FT by
(Ff)(ξ)=1√
2π∫Rf(t)e−itξdt. (11)
It is known that the operator Fis a homeomorphism on L2(R),and has {e−inπ
2}∞
n=0as the eigen values with corre-
sponding eigen functions {e−1
2t2Hn(t)}∞
n=0,where Hnis the Hermite polynomial of degree n,i.e.,
Hn(t)=(−1)net2dn
dtne−t2, n∈N.
Renaming the operator Fin equation (11) as Fπ
2,we see that
Fπ
2[e−1
2t2Hn(t)](ξ)=e−inπ
2e−1
2ξ2Hn(ξ). (12)
Namias ( [141]), considered the operator Fα,given by
Fα[e−1
2t2Hn(t)](ξ)=e−inαe−1
2ξ2Hn(ξ), α∈C (13)
obtained by replacingπ
2byαin the eigen value equation (12). Any function f∈L2(R),can be written as
f(t)=∞
∑
n=0ane−t2
2Hn(t), (14)
where anis obtained, using the orthogonal property of the Hermite polynomials, as
an=1
2nn!√π∫Re−t2
2Hn(t)f(t)dt.
Taking Fαon both sided of equation (14) and using equation (13), results in
(Fαf)(ξ)=∞
∑
n=0ane−inπ
2e−ξ2
2Hn(ξ) (15)
The calculation of Fαusing (15) is usually not practical. Namias [141] obtained the following integral representation

and called it the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT). McBride et al. [134] pointed out that the Fαin (15) and Fαin
(16) are not the same for all α∈C,because the former has period 2 πwhile the later has period 4 π.Thus equation (16)
is not, after all, an integral representation of the original Fαfor all α∈C.Also problem arises when sin αbecomes
zero or negative. The right hand side of (16) makes sense only when α≠nπ, n∈Z,and we need to specify which
branch of (sinα)1
2is used when sin α<0.So they considered a new family of FrFT Fα, α∈R,given by

and proved that the transforms Fα, α∈Rare homeomorphisms on the Schwartz space S(R),along with the index

F0f=f,∀f∈L2(R)
∥Fαf−f∥L2(R)→0 asα→0, f∈L2(R),
i.e.,{Fα}is a strongly continuous unitary group of operators on L2(R).Almeida in [7] gave the kernel of the FrFT
in the following form

He obtained some important properties of the kernel like Kα(t, ξ)=Kα(ξ, t), K−α(t, ξ)=Kα(t, ξ),∫RKα(t, ξ′)Kβ(ξ′, ξ)dξ′=
Kα+β(t, ξ)and∫RKα(t, ξ)Kα(t, ξ′)dt=δ(ξ−ξ′)and also gave the formula for the FrFT of translation and modulation
i.e.,
(Fα(f(t−τ)))(ξ)=(Fαf)(ξ−τcosα)eiτ2
2sinαcosα−iξτsinα
and
(Fα(f(t)eiνt))(ξ)=(Fαf)(ξ−τsinα)e−iτ2
2sinαcosα+iξνcosα.
Almeida [8] obtained the expression of the FrFT of the product and the convolution of two functions in the space
L1(R)∩W,where Wis the Wigner algebra consisting of functions which are the FT of functions in L1(R).The
expression of the FrFT of the product and convolution of f, g∈L1(R)∩W,are given respectively by the following :
(Fα(fg))(ξ)=∣cscα∣√
2πeiξ2
2cotα∫R(Fαf)(ν)(Fπ

(Fα(f∗g))(ξ)=∣secα∣e−iξ2
2tanα∫R(Fαf)(ν)g[(ξ−ν)secα]e−iν2
2tanαdν, (20)
where the convolution ∗is defined by
(f∗g)(x)=∫Rf(t)g(x−t)dt. (21)
This can equivalently written as
(f∗g)(x)=∫Rf(t)(τtg)(x)dt, (22)
where τt,is the time shifted operator, given as (τtg)(x)=g(x−t).
Several methods can be adopted to extend the integral transform to a class of generalized functions. Important
among them is
7
•Embedding or kernel method: The kernel of an integral transform is embedded in a suitable space of test
functions. The dual of a test function space is a space of generalized functions. The integral transform of the
member of this dual space is defined as the function obtained by taking the action of the member on the kernel of
the transform. Precisely, If Ais a space of test function with A⋆as its dual, then with the assumption that the
kernel of the integral transforms k(t, x)∈A,the integral transform of f∈A⋆is given by F(x)=⟨f(t), k(t, x)⟩.
•Adjoint Operator method: This method involves the construction of two test function spaces AandBsuch that
the integral transform ImapsAontoB.The integral transform Ifof any generalized function f∈B⋆is defined
as an element of A⋆,given by ⟨If, ϕ⟩=⟨f,Iϕ⟩, ϕ∈A.
L. Schwartz first applied this method to extend the FT to tempered distribution, dual of the test function space
consisting of C∞function of rapid decay. This method can mainly be used when the kernel of the transform is
not necessarily an infinitely differential function, as in the case of the Hilbert transform.
•Algebraic method: This method is different from the one discussed above; it uses the algebraic structure of the
integral transform. This method results in the space of generalized functions, the elements of which are called
Boehmians. The theory of Boehmians, introduced by J. Mikusin` ski in [138], as a space of generalized functions,
was motivated by the concept of Boehme’s regular operators [43]. The algebraic construction of Boehmians is
similar to the construction of the field of quotients. The main difference is that Boehmians can be constructed
even if the ring has zero divisors. If the construction is applied to a function space and the multiplication is
interpreted as convolution, the construction yields a space of generalized functions. These spaces provide a
natural setting for the extension of the transform like FT, Radon transform, Zak transform, etc. [139].
For other methods like sequence or limit method and indirect method (where the considered transform is expressed
in terms of another integral transform which is defined in some space of generalized functions), we refer the reader
to [45], [220]. Zayed [103] extended the FrFT to different spaces of generalized function. Similar to the method
adopted by Zemanian to extend the Laplace transform to generalized functions, Zayed used the embedding method to
extend the FrFT to the generalized function with compact support. He also used the algebraic method to construct
suitable space of Boehmians. For that, he introduced a new convolution structure [103], [218]
(f⋆g)(x)=c(α)√
2πe−ia(α)x2(˜f∗˜g)(x), (23)
where∗is the classical convolution (21), ˜h(x)=h(x)eia(α)x2, a(α)=cotα
2andc(α)=√
1−icotαfor the FrFT, as the
FrFT does not behave very nicely under the convolution (21). The FrFT of the convolution ⋆is given by
(Fα(f⋆g))(ξ)=(Fαf)(ξ)(Fαg)(ξ)e−ia(α)ξ2. (24)
This equation (24) finds its application in filter design. Like, if we are interested only in the frequency spectrum of
the FrFT of fin the region [ξ1, ξ2],we choose g (the filter impulse response) in such a way that Fαgis constant
over[ξ1, ξ2],and zero or rapidly decays outside that reason. Thus we have the spectrum of fover[ξ1, ξ2],passing
output of the filter through the chirp multiplier, eia(α)ξ2.This is easier as compared to the one suggested in [8].
Taking advantage of the newly defined convolution (23) and the associated convolution formula (24), he extended the
definition of the FrFT to that of the Boehmians. Zayed in [217] obtained the relation between the FrFT and the FT,
which is given by
e−ia(α)ξ2(Fαf)(ξ)=c(α)(Fπ
2˜f)(2a(α)b(α)ξ),˜f(t)=eiat2f(t). (25)
Based on relation (25), Zayed obtained the sampling theorem that can be used to reconstruct the signal or its FrFT
from their samples at a discrete set of points satisfying the Nyquist rate and the inversion formula for the FrFT from
the corresponding results in Fourier analysis [219] by suitable change of variable. The proof obtained is easier as
compared to the one obtained by Xia in [211]. Xia [211] studied the properties of bandlimited and time-limited signals
and generalized the fact that a non-zero function cannot be both time-limited as well as bandlimited by showing that
a non-zero function fcannot be bandlimited simultaneously with FrFT Fαfor a certain value of α,and FrFT Fβ,
with β≠±α+mπ,∀n∈Z.Mendlovic et al. in [135] gave a definition of fractional convolution of functions fandg
in terms of functions in fractional Fourier domain as
(fEαg)(t)=F−α(Fαf(ξ)Fαg(ξ))(t), (26)
followed by the definition of the fractional correlation defined as
CORRα(f, g)=(fEα¯g). (27)
8
Equation (26) can be expressed in terms of integral as
(fEαg)(t)=∣cscα∣
2π∫R∫R∫Reit′2+u2+τ2−t2
2cotαe−iu(t−τ−t′)cscαf(t′)h(τ)dt′dudτ,
which is, unfortunately, complicated to reduce into single integral as in the case of ordinary FT. Ozaktas et al. [143]
introduced an alternative fractional convolution as
(fHαg)(t)=(F−α[(Fαf)(ξ)∗(Fαg)(ξ)])(t)
=∫Rf(τ)g(tcosα−τ)eiπt2cosαsinα−i2πtτsinαdτ. (28)
This definition of fractional convolution in equation (28) lacks the classical convolution theorem, i.e., the FT of
convolution of the functions is the product of their corresponding FT. Shi et al. [180] defined a simple fractional
convolution structure given by
(f⋆αh)(t)=e−i
2t2cotα[(f(⋅)ei
2(⋅)2cotα)∗h(⋅)]
=∫Rh(τ)f(t−τ)e−iτ(t−τ
2)cotαdτ, (29)
which satisfies
Fα[(f⋆αh)](ξ)=√
2π(Fαf)(ξ)(Fh)(ξcscα). (30)
Based on the fractional time shift operator given by (Tα
τf)(t)=f(t−τ)e−iτ(t−τ
2)cotα,which generalizes the classical
translation operator (Tτf)(t)=f(t−τ),the fractional convolution in (29) can be written in the form
(f⋆αh)(t)=∫Rh(τ)(Tα
τf)(t)dτ. (31)
Shi et al. [183] gave a generalized definition of convolution associated with the FrFT ‘ ⋆α,β,γ’ as
(f⋆α,β,γ h)(t)=∫Rh(τ)(Tβ
τf)(t)ϕα,β,γ(t, τ)dτ
=e−i
2t2cotα[g(⋅)ei

where⋆denotes the classical convolution operator and
ϕα,β,γ(u, v)=eiv2
2cotγ+iu2
2(cotβ−cotα). (33)
The generalized convolution theorem associated to (32) is given by
Fα[(f⋆α,β,γ h)(t)](u)=ϵα,β,γ(u)(Fβf)(ucscα
cscβ)(Fγh)(ucscα
cscγ), (34)
where ϵα,β,γ(u)=Aα

reduces to the one studied in [118], [180], [199], [218] for some constraints on α, βandγ.The fractional translation
operator
(Tα
τf)(t)=f(t−τ)e−iτ(t−τ
2)cotα
satisfies (Tα
τf)(t)Fα
↔Fα(u)e−iuτcscα.Similarly, we can formulate a fractional frequency-shift operator, denoted by
Uα

(Uα

2)cotα
where it is easy to verify that f(t)eitvcscαFα

⎠,then the
FrFTFα,βoff∈L1(R2)is defined by Zayed [216] as
(Fα,βf)(u)=∫R2f(x)Kα,β(x,u)dx, (35)
9
where Kα,β(x,u)=de−i[˜a(∣x∣2+∣u∣2)−x⋅ζu].This definition is not the tensor product of two one-dimensional transforms
and is based on using the Hermite functions of complex variables [104] as eigen functions of the transform. Ka-
malakkannan et al. [106] gave the rigorous proof to extend the definition to the functions in f∈L2(R2)in the natural
way i.e., Fα,βfis the L2(R2)limit of Fα,βfn,where{fn}is a sequence in L1(R2)∩L2(R2)such that fn→finL2(R2)
asn→∞.Moreover, Fα,βis a unitary operator on L2(R2).It is easy to observe that when α=βandα=β=π
2,then
Fα,βbecomes the tensor product of two one-dimensional FrFT and the classical two-dimensional FT respectively. The
coupled FrFT (35) can be written in terms of the FT as
(Fα,βf)(u)=2πdE−1
γ(u)̂fE−1γ(−ζu), (36)
where Eγ(x)=ei˜a∣x∣2andE−1
γ(x)=ei˜a∣x∣2,x∈R2.Furthermore, Fα,βsatisfies F−α,−βFα,βf=f,for all f∈L2(R2).In
particular, if Fα,βf∈L1(R2),then f(x)=∫R2(Fα,βf)(u)K−α,−β(u,x)du,a.e. ( [216]). Authors in [106] also obtained
the additive property Fα2,β2(Fα1,β1f)=Fα1+α2,β1+β2(f), f∈L2(R2),where the parameters satisfy the conditions
α1+β1, α2+β2, α1+β1+α2+β2∉2πZ.Forf∈Lp(R2), p=1,2 and g∈L1(R),the convolution associated with the
coupled FrFT is given in [216] and [106] as
(f⊗g)(x)=2πdE γ(x)[f(⋅)E−1
γ(⋅)⋆g(⋅)E−1
γ(⋅)](x), (37)
where⋆is the convolution given by (f⋆g)(x)=1
2π∫R2f(x−y)g(y)dyand the associated convolution theorem is
given by Fα,β(f⊗g)=EγFα,βfFα,βg.Recently, Topan et al. [198] obtained the sharp Hausdorff-Young inequality
for the coupled FrFT (36) which is given for f∈Ls(R2),where1

.Moving forward to the higher dimensional FrFT, Verma et al. [200]
introduced the FrFT for the function f∈L2(R)of real order α,using the n−copies of the kernel of one dimensional
fractional Fourier kernel and is defined as
(Fαf)(ξ)=∫Rnf(t)Kα(t,ξ)dξ,ξ∈Rn, (38)

2.It is to be noted that the definition (38) reduces

2.Analogous to the classical definition of the FT the definition of the
FrFT (38) can be interpreted as Fαf=limn→∞FαfninL2(Rn),where{fn}nis a sequence in L1(Rn)∩L2(Rn)
such that fn→finL2(Rn).The existence and uniqueness of the lim n→∞Fαfnfollows from the identity ∥f∥L2(Rn)=
∥Fαf∥L2(Rn),∀f∈L1(Rn)∩L2(Rn).Authors in [200] proved the Parseval’s formula ⟨f, g⟩L2(Rn)=⟨Fαf,Fαg⟩L2(Rn)
followed by the additive property Fα(Fβf)=Fα+βf, f∈L2(Rn).Based on the convolution ⋆αdefined by (f⋆αg)(t)=
∫Rne−i

followed by the additive property Fα(Fβf)=Fα+βf, f∈L2(Rn).They also introduced a generalized fractional

Uncertainty Principles: The UP in the time-frequency plane plays a vital role in signal processing. It states
that for a given function f∈L2(R)such that ∥f∥L2(R)=1,the product of its spread in the time domain and frequency
domain is bounded below and is given by
(∫R(t−t0)2∣f(t)∣2dt)(∫R(ξ−ξ0)2∣(Ff)(ξ)∣2dξ)≥1
4, (44)
where t0=∫Rt∣f(t)∣2dtandξ0=∫Rξ∣(Ff)(ξ)∣2dξ.It has been seen in the [11], [142] that the lower bound of the
product of the spread in the time domain and the FrFT domain is given bysin2α
4.This can also be obtained using the
UP for the FT and the relation between FrFT and the FT given by (25). Shinde et al. [186] gave the lower bound of

obtained that the shifting has no effect on the inequality, whereas the scaling of the signal has the following form.

It is to be noted that for n=1,the Heisenberg’s UP (54) reduces to the one obtained by Guanlei [79] for one-

3.1 Fractional Fourier transform of type II
IfS(R)is the space of rapidly decreasing test functions, then the Lizorkin space Φ (R)is the Fourier pre-image of the
space V(R)in the space S(R),i.e.,
Φ(R)={ϕ∈S(R)∶ˆϕ∈V(R)},
where V(R)is the set of all v∈S(R)satisfying the conditionsdnv(x)
dxn∣x=0=0, n=0,1,2,⋯.It is to be noted that the
space Φ (R)is invariant with respect to the fractional integration and differentiation operators, which is not the case
for the whole space S(R).Luchko et al. [132] introduced a new definition of the FrFT of real order α(0<α≤1)for a
function u∈Φ(R)as
(Fαu)(ω)=∫Ru(t)eα(ω, t)dt, ω∈R, (60)
13
where
eα(ω, t)=eisgn(ω)∣ω∣1
αt=⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩e−i∣ω∣t, ω≤0,
ei∣ω∣t, ω≥0.
It is to be noted that for α=1,the kernel eα(ω, t)coincides with that of the kernel of the conventional FT, i.e., the
FrFT (60) reduces to the classical FT when α=1.Moreover the relation between the FrFT (60) and the classical FT
is given by the formula
(Fαu)(ω)=ˆu(x) (61)
where x=sgn(ω)∣ω∣1
α=⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩−∣ω∣1
α, ω≤0,
∣ω∣1
α, ω≥0.Using this formula and the known properties of the FT, one can calculate
the FrFT of the concrete functions and determine the inversion of the FrFT. Kilbas et al. [113] obtained the inversion
formula of (60) as
(F−1
αu)(x)=1
2πα∫Re−isgn(ω)∣ω∣1
αx∣ω∣1
α−1u(ω)dω, x∈R, α>0, (62)
foru∈Φ(R)and also obtain the FrFT of the translation and dilation of u∈Φ(R)respectively as
(Fα(τhu))(ω)=eisgn(ω)∣ω∣1
αh(Fαu)(ω) (63)
and
(Fα(u(λt)))(ω)=1
λ(Fαu)(ω
λα), λ>0. (64)
Apart from this authors also obtained the convolution theorem for the FrFT as
(Fα(k⋆u))(ω)=(Fαk)(ω)(Fαu)(ω) (65)
followed by the formula
(Fαum)(ω)=(−isgn(ω)∣ω∣1
α)m
(Fαu)(ω), (66)
where⋆denotes the classical convolution and k, u∈Φ(R).Observe that the formulas given by equations (63), (64), (65)
and (66) reduces to the corresponding formulas in the case of classical FT when α=1.We know that the conditions of
their validity can be improved, for example the convolution theorem for the classical FT is valid for either k∈L1(R)
andu∈L1(R),ork∈L2(R)andu∈L1(R)ork∈L2(R)andu∈L2(R).Thus, using the relation (61), authors in [113]
mentioned that the condition of validity of the formulas given in equations (63), (64), (65) and (66) can be improved
as in the case of FT. Srivastava et al. [190] proved that the transform (60) and its inverse is an isomorphism from
S(R)onto itself. Srivastava et al. [188] studied the FrFT given by (60) for the functions in L2(R)and obtained the
Parseval formula for f, g∈L2(R)as
∫Rf(t)g(t)dt=1
2πα∫R∣ω∣1
α−1(Fαf)(ω)(Fαg)(ω)dω.
4 Linear Canonical Transform (LCT)
Moshinsky and Quesne proposed linear canonical transform (LCT) [140] in the early 1990s, which is a promising
linear integral transform with three free parameters. It is a generalization of several integral transforms like FT,
FrFT, Fresnel transform, and the scaling operations. For a real, unimodular matrix M=(A, B, C, D ),the LCT of a
function f∈L2(R2)is defined by
(LMf)(ξ)=∫Rf(t)KM(t, ξ)dt, (67)
where the kernel KM(t, ξ)is given by
KM(t, ξ)=1√
2πiBei(At2−2tξ+Dξ2)
2B , B≠0. (68)
It can be seen from (67) and (68), that for special choices of M, (67) reduces to several known integral transforms like
14
1. for M=(0,1,−1,0),definition (67) reduces to classical FT
2. for M=(cosθ,sinθ,−sinθ,cosθ), θ≠nπ, n∈Zdefinition (67) reduces to FrFT
3. for M=(1, B,0,1), B≠0 definition (67) reduces to classical Fresnel transform.
Determining a convolution theorem by defining a suitable convolution associated with a given transform has become
an active area of research. Different transform requires different definitions of convolutions to obtain the associated
convolution theorem. Like in the case of FT, it gives the powerful result that the convolution “ ⋆”, in (21), of two
signals in the time domain results in simple multiplication of their FTs in the FT domain. However, the LCT of
(f⋆g)(t)is given by [62]
(LM(f∗g))(u)=∣1
A∣e−iC
2Au2
∫∞
−∞(LMf)(v)e−ıC
2Av2g(u−v
A)dv. (69)
This formula lacks the requirement that the convolution in the time domain is the product of LCTs in the LCT
domain. Moreover, it is inconvenient for the analysis of multiplicative filters in the LCT domain. Deng et al. [62] also
gave another convolution theorem for the LCT
(LM(f⋆Mg))(u)=√
i2πB(LMf)(u)(LMg)(u)e−iD
2Bu2(70)
based on the modified convolution operation given by
(f⋆Mg)(t)=e−iA
2Bt2((f(⋅)eiA
2B(⋅)2)∗(g(⋅)eiA
2B(⋅)2))(t)
=∫Rf(y)g(t−y)eiy(y−t)A
Bdy (71)
Even though the convolution theorem for the LCT given in (70) satisfies our need for getting the product of LCTs
in the LCT domain, during the process of evaluation of the convolution (71), the signal are multiplied three times by
the different chirp signals. From realization point of view, this may create difficulty as in communication system, it
is nearly impossible to generate a chirp signal accurately. Wei et al. [206] generalized the convolution theorem for the
LCT as
⎛
⎝LM(fM
Θg)⎞
⎠(u)=(LMf)(u)(LMg)(u) (72)
whereM
Θdenotes generalized convolution (fM
Θg)(t)=∫Rf(τ)g(tθτ)dτin the LCT domain, where g(tθτ)is the
τ−generalized translation of signal g(t)byτ. This convolution theorem has the needed form that the convolution in
the time domain is equal to the product of the LCTs in the LCT domain, as in the case of the classical result for the
FT. However, it is complicated to reduce the expression of the generalized convolution to a single integral form as in
ordinary convolution (21). So, it is difficult to implement it compared to the FT. For the function fwith ˜f(t)=eiAt2
2B,
Wei et al. [205] proposed a new convolution for the LCT of fandgis defined as
(f⋆′
Mg)(t)=e−iAt2
2B(˜f⋆g)(t) (73)
and obtain the following convolution theorem
(LM(f⋆′
Mg))(u)=(LMf)(u)(Fg)(u
B), (74)
where(Fg)(u)=∫Rg(t)e−itudt.Thus, the LCT of the convolution ⋆′given by (73) is the multiplication of the LCT
of the one with the FT of the other. Moreover, the convolution can be expressed by one-dimensional integrals, as in
the ordinary convolution expression, which is useful and easy to implement, particularly in filter designing.
The classical convolution has translational invariance property, i.e.,
τz(f⋆g)=(τzf)⋆g=g⋆(τzg),
where⋆denotes the convolution given by (21) and (τzf)(t)=f(t−z).So many convolution structures are defined for
LCT in the literature, as discussed. Wei et al. [204] pointed out that the convolution structure ⋆Mgiven by (71) is
15
not translational invariance with respect to the translation operator τz,so they generalized the notion of translation
and called it as linear canonical translation which is as follows:
For the LCT parameter M=(A, B, C, D )and value z,TM;zf∶=(f⋆Mδ)e−iAz2
2B,which can be equivalently written
as
(TM;zf)(t)=f(t−z)e−iz(t−z
2)A
B.
ForM=(0,1,−1,0)TM,z=τz(which is the usual translation by z). With this linear canonical translation operator,
they obtained the translation invariant property for LCT i.e.,
TM;z(f⋆Mg)=(TM;zf)⋆Mg=f⋆M(TM;zg)
Motivated by the definition (22) of classical convolution, Shi et al. [181] introduced a generalized canonical convolution
operator,⋆M1,M2,M3,forf, g∈L2(R)in the time domain as
(f⋆M1,M2,M3h)(t)=∫+∞

is a domain-independent weighted
function. It is to be noted that the convolution ⋆M1,M2,M3given by equation (75) reduces to the convolution operator
⋆α,β,γ (33), for the choice of the matrices M1=(cosβ,sinβ;−sinβ,cosβ), M2=(cosγ,sinγ;−sinγ,cosγ)andM3=
(cosα,sinα;−sinα,cosα). They also obtained the convolution theorem associated with the generalized convolution
(75) as
LM3[f⋆M1,M2,M3h](u)=ϵM1,M2,M3(u)(LM1f)(uB1
B3)(LM1h)(uB2
B3) (76)
where(LM1f)(u)and(LM2h)(u)respectively denote the LCT with parameter M1off(t)and the LCT with

is a domain-independent weighted function. The convolution result for the LCT given in (76) generalized several con-
volution theorems for particular choices of the matrix parameter M1, M 2andM3[62], [118], [180], [199], [204], [218].
The sampling process is central in almost all domains of mathematics. One of the most fundamental concepts
in digital signal processing is the sampling process, which serves as a link between a continuous and discrete signal.
Before we proceed with our discussion on the sampling theorem, we need to know that a signal is said to be time-
limited if it is compactly supported in the time domain, whereas it is band-limited if it is compactly supported in
the transformed domain. We have interesting results concerning the support of the signal in the LCT domain. It
says that if a nonzero signal f(t)is band-limited in the LCT domain with parameter M1=(A1B1
C1D1), then f(t)
cannot be band-limited with another parameter M2=(A2B2
C2D2), satisfying the relationship A1/B1≠A2/B2. By
virtue of this, it follows that if a signal is non-bandlimited in the Fourier domain, then it can be band-limited in the
LCT domain. Healy et al. [94] presented non-band-limited signals in the Fourier domain that are band-limited in the
LCT domain. So, it is important to establish the sampling theorem for the band-limited function in the LCT domain.
Stern [192] obtained the sampling theorem for the LCT of the compactly supported functions in the time domain or
the LCT domain. Even though the formulae given in [192] can be used to reconstruct the original signal or its LCT
from their samples at a discrete set of points that satisfies the Nyquist rate of that particular domain, it is not strictly
in an interpolation form. Keeping this in mind Li et al. [123] developed a sampling theorem for f(t)band-limited to
ΩMin the LCT domain with parameter M=(A B
C D)andB>0 as
f(t)=e−iA

where Tis the sampling period and satisfies T=πB/ΩM; and the Nyquist rate of sampling theorem associated with
the LCT is fs=ΩM/πB. The result (77), which is derived using the relation between the LCT and the FT, is
more explicit than that given in [192], and its derivation is easier than that in [62]. It also generalizes the sampling
theorem for the FrFT studied in [211], [217]. From an application point of view, when sampling non-stationary signals
or broadband signals, the sampling condition in (77) may not always hold because of the requirement of the low
sampling rate. So, Li et al. [123] also developed the following sampling formulae that are used to reconstruct the
signal from the samples of the signal and its first derivatives or its generalized Hilbert transform [122] associated with
the LCT each at half of the Nyquist rate.
1. If f(t)is band-limited to Ω Min LCT sense and has a continuous first derivative. Then the following sampling

where T1=2T=2πB/ΩM, f′(kT1)=f′(t)∣t=kT1.
2. If a signal f(t)is band-limited to Ω Min the LCT sense. Then f(t)can be represented by the samples of f(t)
and its generalized Hilbert transform HM[f(t)]at half Nyquist rate as follows:

where T2=2T=2πB/ΩM. Equation (79) is an extension of the result in [221] associated with the FrFT.
Equation (77) establishes the relationship between the signal samples and the original signal; that is to say, we can
reconstruct the original signal or the LCT of a band-limited signal in the LCT domain from the uniform sampling
points of the signal, provided the sampling interval satisfies the uniform sampling conditions. However, when applying
this formula in practical situations, two problems are encountered. The first is concerned with nonuniform sampling
signal processing, and the other is related to the fact that only a finite number of samples are practically available.
This problem is addressed in [195].
Uncertainty Principles: Guanlei et al. [80] extended the traditional Pitt’s inequality in two LCT domain as

where E(ρ(x))=−∫Rρ(x)lnρ(x)dx, ρ(x)is the probability density function and the Heisenberg’s UP in two LCT

noted that (80), (82) and (83) depends only on the parameters AandBbut not on CandD,because from the
definition of the LCT it is seen that the parameters CandDonly play the role of scaling and modulation and
that they have no effect on the inequality (80), (82) and (83). If M1=(0,−1,1,1)andM2=(1

(81),(82) and (83) reduces respectively to the logarithmic UP, entropy UP and Heisenberg’s UP [78], [79] for the
FrFT and to the traditional case [71] when M1=(1,0,0,1)andM2=(0,1,−1,0),i.e., in the later case (80), (81),
(82) and (83) reduces, respectively, to the traditional Pitt’s inequality [36], logarithmic UP by Beckner [38], Shannon
entropy [96] and Heisenberg UP. Guanlei et al. [81] obtained the R´ enyi entropy-based UP in two LCT domains as

5 Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform (QPFT)
Recently, Castro et al. [50] developed a new integral transform called the QPFT (QPFT), which generalizes sev-
eral transforms like FT, FrFT, and LCT. For the function f∈L1(R)orf∈L2(R)and given parameter Λ =
(A, B, C, D, E ), B≠0,the QPFT is defined by
(QΛf)(ω)∶=∫RKi
Λ(x, ω)f(x)dx, (87)
where the kernel is given by
Ki
Λ(x, ω)=1√
2πe−i(Ax2+Bxω+Cω2+Dx+Eω), (88)
they proved the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, inversion formula, Plancherel’s extension theorem and also the Parseval
identity given by
⟨QΛf, Q Λg⟩L2(R)=1
∣B∣⟨f, g⟩L2(R), f, g∈L2(R)
denotes the usual inner product in L2(R)given by ⟨f, g⟩L2(R)∶=∫Rf(x)g(x)dx. In the special case of f=g, we then
have
∥QΛf∥2
L2(R)=1
∣B∣∥f∥2
L2(R).
18
They also gave several new convolutions followed by the corresponding convolution theorem, which, in partic-
ular cases, was the convolution theorem for the FT, FrFT, and LCT. They also obtained the Young’s convo-
lution inequalities associated with these convolutions. Shah et al. [174] proved that the transform (87) is lin-
ear and has the translation formula QΛ[f(t−k)](ω)=e−i(Ak2+Bkω+Dk)QΛ[e−2iAktf(t)](ω),modulation formula
QΛ[eiµtf(t)](ω)=ei

QΛ[f(µt)](ω)=1

µ2)−iEω(1−1
µ)(QΛF)(ω
µ),
where F(t)=ei(At2(1−1
µ2)+Dt(1−1
µ))
f(t).They also gave the following convolution theorem
(QΛ[f⊗Λg])(ω)=ei(Cω2+Eω)(QΛf)(ω)(QΛg)(ω), (89)
with the convolution ⊗Λgiven by
(f⊗Λg)(t)=1√
2x∫Rf(x)g(t−x)e2iAx(t−x)dx. (90)
Kumar et al. [120] proved the continuity of the linear map QA,B,C
D,E∶S(R)/leftfootl⫯ne→SΩ(R),where QA,B,C
D,Eis defined as
(QA,B,C
D,Ef)(y)=√
B
2πi∫Re−i(Ax2+Bxy+Cy2+Dx+Ey)f(x)dx (91)
where S(R)is a Schwartz space and SΩ(R)is the Schwartz-type space which contains a complex-valued C∞-function
φonR, such that for every pair (α, β)of non-negative integers, it satisfies
Γα,β
Ω(φ)=sup
x∈R∣xα∆β
x,aφ(x)∣<∞,
where
∆x,A=(d
dx−2iAx)
and ∆β
x,A=∑β
j=0pβ
j(x)Dβ−j
x;pβ
jdenotes the polynomial of order jwith pβ
0(x)=1. They also extended the definition
of the QPFT to the space of all tempered distribution S′(R),given by
⟨QA,B,C
D,Ef, φ⟩∶=⟨f, QA,B,C
D,Eφ⟩
for all φ∈S(R),where S′(R)consists of all continuous linear functions f∶S(R)→Cand proved that QPFT is a
continuous linear map from S′(R)onto itself. Prasad et al. [161] proved the convolution theorem for the QPFT as
(QA,B,C
D,E(f⋆ΩA
Dψ))(ω)=√
2πi
Be−iCω2−iEω(QA,B,C
D,Ef)(ω)(QA,B,C

forf, ψ∈SΩ(R),where the convolution ⋆ΩA
Dis defined as
(f⋆ΩA
Dψ)(x)=∫Rf(y)ψ(x−y)e−iA(x2−y2)−iD(x−y)dy. (93)
Shah et al. [177] defined a quadratic-phase convolution of f, g∈L2(R)as
(f⋆′
Λg)(z)=1√
2π∫Rf(t)g(z−t)e−2iAt(t−z)dt (94)
and proved that the QPFT (87) satisfies the formula (QΛ(f⋆′
Λg))(ω)=ei(Cω2+Eω)(QΛf)(ω)(QΛg)(ω).They
also defined the correlation of f, g∈L2(R)as(f○′
Λg)(z)=1√
2π∫Rf(t)g(t−z)e2iAz(z−t)dtand the corresponding
correlation formula as (QΛ(f○′
Λg))(ω)=ei(Cω2+Eω)(QΛf)(ω)(QΛg)(ω).Lone et al. [130] proposed the convolutions
associated with the QPFT followed by the corresponding convolution theorem. These convolution operations enjoy
both the commutative and the associative properties. We mention below such convolutions along with the associated
convolution theorems.
19
1. For any pair of square integrable functions f1andf2, the quadratic-phase convolution is denoted by ⊕Λand is
defined as
(f1⊕Λf2)(z)=∣B∣eiAz2(ˇf1(B⋅)⋆ˇf2(⋅))(z)eiDz, (95)
where ˘f(t)=f(t)e−iAt2and⋆represents the classical convolution operator. The corresponding convolution
theorem is given by
(QΛ[f1⊕Λf2])(ω)=ei{C(ω
B}2+E(ω
B))(QΛF1)(ω
B)(QΛF2)(ω
B), (96)
where F1(t)=eiDtf1(t)andF2(t)=eiDtf2(t).
2. For a set of parameters Λ =(A, B, C, D, E ), B≠0 and any pair of functions f1, f2∈L2(R), the weighted
quadratic-phase convolution is denoted by ∗Λand is defined as
(f1∗Λf2)(z)=1√
2π∫Rf1(t)f2(z−t)eiA(z2−t2)dt, (97)
with the corresponding convolution theorem as
(QΛ[f1∗Λf2])(ω)=ei(Cω2+Eω)(QΛf1)(ω)(QΛf2)(ω). (98)
The convolution theorem in equations (96) and (98) are such that they contain an extra chirp. So, Lone et al. [130], [131]
also gave some convolution in the context of QPFT such that the corresponding convolution theorem has no chirp
multiplier. In what follows, we mention such convolution followed by the associated convolution theorem
1. For a set of parameters Λ =(A, B, C, D, E )and any pair of functions f1, f2∈L2(R), the chirp-free weighted
convolution associated with the QPFT is denoted by ⋆Λand is defined as
(f1⋆Λf2)(z)=1√
2π∫Rf1(t)f2(z−t)eiA(z2−t2)dt, (99)
with the corresponding convolution theorem as
(QΛ[f1⋆Λf2])(ω)=(QΛf1)(ω)(FF2)(Bω), (100)
whereF[F2]represents the FT of F2(t)=e−iDtf2(t). The convolution operation given in (99) do not satisfy
commutative nor associative properties. The convolution given below is a chirp free convolution operation which
satisfy commutative as well as associative properties.
2. For a parametric set Λ =(A, B, C, D, E ), B≠0, the chirp-free quadratic-phase convolution of functions f1, f2∈
L2(R)is denoted by ⊙Λand is given by
(f1⊙Λf2)(z)=1√
2π∫Rf1(t)f2(√
2z−t)e−2iA(z√
2−t)2
dt, (101)
with the corresponding convolution theorem as
(QΛ[f1⊙Λf2])(ω)=1√
2(QΛ′f1)(ω√
2)(QΛ′f2)(ω√
2),Λ′=(A, B, C,D√
2,E√
2) (102)
Lone et al. [129] defined the discrete-time QPFT of any sequence u(n)∈ℓ2(Z),denoted by DΩ[u(n)],as
DΩ[u(n)](ω)=1√
2π∑
n∈Zu(n)e−i(An2+Bnω+Cω2+Dn+Eω), (103)
which generalized the discrete-time FrFT [40], discrete-time FrFT [40] and discrete-time FT as [59]. The inversion
formula corresponding to (103) is given by
u(n)=∫2π/B
0DΩ[u(n)](ω)KΩ(n, ω)dω, (104)
20
where KΩ(n, ω)=e−i(An2+Bnω+Cω2+Dn+Eω).They also introduced the notion of discrete convolution and semi-discrete
convolution in the context of QPFTs for u(n), v(n)∈ℓ2(Z)andϕ∈L2(R), denoted by ⊕Dand⊛Srespectively, as
u(n)⊕Dv(n)=1√
2π∑
n∈Zu(n)v(k−n)e−2πiAn(n−k)(105)
and
u(n)⊛Sϕ(t)=1√
2π∑
n∈Zs(n)ϕ(t−n)e−2πiAn(n−t). (106)
The operation of convolution ⊕Ddefined in (105) is commutative and associative. Moreover, the convolution theorem
for (103) associated with (105) and (106) are given respectively by
DΩ[u(n)⊕Dv(n)](ω)=ei(Cω2+Eω)DΩ[u(n)](ω)DΩ[v(n)](ω) (107)
and
LΩ[u(n)⊛Sϕ](ω)=ei(Cω2+Eω)DΩ[u(n)](ω)LΩ[ϕ](ω). (108)
Moreover, ∣DΩ[u(n)](ω)∣is periodic with periodicity2π
B. Authors in [131] have introduced a pair of novel discrete
and semi-discrete convolution structures in the framework of QPFT for x(n), y(n)∈ℓ2(Z)andϕ∈L2(R),denoted
respectively by ☆Dand☆Sand are defined by
x(n)☆Dy(n)=1√
2π∑
n∈Zx(n)y(k−n)eiA(k2−n2)(109)
and
x(n)☆Sϕ(t)=1√
2π∑
n∈Zx(n)ϕ(t−n)eiA(t2−n2). (110)
The operation of convolution ☆Ddefined in (109) is neither commutative nor associative. Moreover, the convolution
theorem associated with (109) and (110) are given respectively by
DΛ[x(n)☆Dy(n)](ω)=DΛ[x(n)](ω)F[yΛ(n)](Bω), (111)
and
IN[x(n)☆Sϕ](ω)=DΛ[x(n)](ω)F[Φ](Bω), (112)
whereF[yΛ(n)]andF[Φ]represent respectively the discrete-time FT of yΛ(n)=e−iDny(n)and FT of Φ (t)=
e−iDtϕ(t).Observe that the convolution results given in (111) and (112) does not contain any chirp multipliers as was
not the case for the convolution result given in (107) and (108).
Shanon’s sampling theorem is one of the remarkable, profound, and elegant concepts of digital signal processing,
which serves as a bridge between analog and digital signals. The theorem asserts that if a bandlimited signal has a
range of nfrequencies, it can be perfectly reconstructed by taking 2 nevenly spaced samples. If we take any additional
samples, it will turn out to be redundant, while as if we take fewer samples, we will lose some quality. This is a
fundamental result in the field of information theory, in particular, telecommunications and signal processing [59].
The Shanon’s sampling theorem for the QPFT serves as a unified sampling theorem for the wide class of integral
transforms. Authors in [129], [87] and [177] proved that a bandlimited function f(t)∈L2(R)with bandwidth σin the
quadratic-phase Fourier domains can be reconstructed from its equally spaced samples f(nτ), n∈Zby the formula
f(t)=ei(At2+Dt)∑
n∈Ze−i(A(nτ)2+D(nτ))sin(Bσ(t−nτ))
Bσ(t−nτ)f(nτ), (113)
where τ=π/Bσis the sampling period.
A closed subspace VofL2(R)is said to be shift-invariant if f(t−n)∈V, whenever f∈V. A closed shift-invariant
subspace V⊂L2(R)is said to be generated by ϕ∈L2(R)ifV=span{ϕ(t−n)∶n∈Z}. Lone et al. [129] introduced the
21
chirp-modulated shift-invariant subspace of L2(R)in the quadratic-phase Fourier domains VΩ(ϕ)for any sequence
u(n)∈ℓ2(Z)andϕ(t)∈L2(R)as
VΩ(ϕ)=closure {f∈L2(R)∶f(z)=(u(n)⊛Sϕ(t))(z)}, (114)
where⊛Sis the semi-discrete convolution given by (106) and established that the necessary and sufficient condition
for{e−2iAn(n−t)ϕ(t−n)}to be a Riesz basis for VΩ(ϕ)is that there exists two positive constants Γ 1and Γ 2such that
Γ1≤∑
n∈Z∣LΩ[ϕ](ω+n)∣2≤Γ2,∀ω∈[0,2π/B] (115)
For any sequence u(n)∈ℓ2(Z)and a collection of functions ϕℓ(t)∈L2(R),1⩽ℓ⩽M, the generalized SISs of L2(R)
with respect to a parametric set Λ =(A, B, C, D, E ), B>0 is denoted as γΛ(ϕ1, . . . , ϕ M)and is defined by

where☆Sdenoted the semi-discrete convolution as defined by (110). Let γΛ(ϕ1, . . . , ϕ M)⊂L2(R)be the gener-
alized SISs associated with the QPFT. Then, the family {eAn(t2−n2)ϕℓ(t−n)∶1⩽ℓ⩽M}forms a Riesz basis for
γΛ(ϕ1, . . . , ϕ M)if and only if there exists a pair of constants Γ 1,Γ2>0 such that

Uncertainty Principles: Using the relation between the QPFT and the classical FT and the Heisenberg’s and
logarithmic UP for the classical FT, Shah et al. [174] obtained the Heisenberg’s UP for the QPFT as
(∫R∣t−t0∣2∣f(t)∣2dt)(∫R∣ω−ω0∣2∣(QΛf)(ω)∣2dt)≥1

2as
∫R∣t∣2α∣f(t)∣2dt≥∣B∣
Cα∣E0∣2α∫E0∣(QΛf)(ω)∣2dω. (120)
Furthermore, they also obtained the Donoho-Stark’s UP for the QPFT, which says that if E1, E2be any two measurable
subsets of Rsuch that fisϵE1−concentrated on E1andQΛfisϵE2−concentrated on E2,then∣E1∣∣E2∣≥1
∣B∣(1−ϵE1−

and Amrein-Berthier-Benedick’s UPs and Hardy’s and Beurling’s UPs are also established in [174].
6 Quaternion Fourier Transform (QFT)
In classical theory of Fourier analysis, it is known that if f∈L1
C(R),then the FT ˆfgiven by ˆf(ξ)=∫Rf(t)e−itξdt
is well defined. Moreover, if ˆfis integrable then fis equivalent to a continuous function and is such that f(t)=
1
2π∫Rˆf(ξ)eitξdξ.There is a natural way of defining the FT of function in L2
C(R)using the density of L1
C(R)∩L2
C(R).
In fact, the FT is not just isometric but also onto from L2
C(R)toL2
C(R).So, there is a natural question: whether there
is an analogous theory of FT for the quaternion-valued function. Because of the non-commutativity of quaternion
multiplication, there are at least three different types of quaternion FT for the quaternion-valued function defined on
R2,namely right-sided, two-sided, and left-sided QFT, which are respectively given as
(Frf)(ω1, ω2)=1
2π∫R2f(x1, x2)e−iω1x1e−jω2x2dx1dx2, (121)
22
(Fsf)(ω1, ω2)=1
2π∫R2e−iω1x1f(x1, x2)e−jω2x2dx1dx2 (122)
and
(Flf)(ω1, ω2)=1
2π∫R2e−iω1x1e−jω2x2f(x1, x2)dx1dx2, (123)
where f∈L1
H(R2).Ernst [69] and Delucs [60] first applied quaternions to FT in the late 1980s. In 1992, Ell [66] analyzed
two-sided QFT and applied it to color image processing. In [67], Ell et al. gave a detailed interpretation of the Fourier
coefficient obtained from a QFT. Following this work, Hitzer [97] studied the right-sided and two-sided QFTs. Chen
et al. [52] systematically developed the QFT theory for the square-integrable quaternion-valued function. One of
the important results in Fourier analysis is the multiplication formula ∫Rˆf(x)g(x)dx=∫Rf(ω)ˆg(ω)dω, f, g∈L2
C(R),
which is not true for right-sided QFT. So, they introduced an auxiliary transform αgiven by αf(x1, x2)=f0(x1, x2)+
if1(x1,−x2)+jf2(−x1, x2)+kf3(−x1,−x2),forf(x1, x2)=f0(x1, x2)+if1(x1, x2)+jf2(x1, x2)+kfk(x1, x2),and
obtained the multiplication formula as
∫R2Fr(x1, x2)g(x1, x2)dx1dx2=∫R2f(x1, x2)Hr(x1, x2)dx1dx2, (124)
where f, g∈L1
H(R2), h=αg, H r=FrhandFr=Frf.Moreover, if g∈L2
H(R2)then∥g∥L2
H(R2)=∥h∥L2
H(R2).This
multiplication formula has been applied to prove that the right-sided QFT is unitary on L2
H(R2).To study the theory
of the two-sided QFT, authors in [52] have obtained the relation of Fswith that of FrasFsf=Fr(βf),where
βf(x1, x2)=f0(x1, x2)+if1(x1, x2)+jf2(−x1, x2)+kf3(−x1, x2).
The two-sided QFT FQ(f)∶R2d↦Hof a quaternion function f∈L1
H(R2d)is defined by [97]
FQ(f)(u,v)=ˆf(u,v)=∫R2de−2πix⋅uf(x,y)e−2πjy⋅vdxdy. (125)
Definition (125) has a symmetrical representation
ˆf(u,v)=ˆf1(u,v)+iˆf2(u,v)+jˆf3(u,v)+iˆf4(u,v)j,
where ˆfl(u,v)=FQ(fl)(u,v), l=1,2,3,4.Chen et al. [51] developed the new module and Lp−norm of ˆfgiven
respectively as
∣ˆf(u,v)∣Q=(∣ˆf1(u,v)∣2+∣ˆf2(u,v)∣2+∣ˆf3(u,v)∣2+∣ˆf4(u,v)∣2)1

which are not equivalent to ∣ˆf∣Qand∥ˆf∥Lp

they also extended the definition (125) of QFT to the functions in L2

H(R2d).The generalization of
two-sided quaternion FT (125) by replacing i, jwith a pair of unit quaternions µ, ν,i.e.,
Fµ,ν(f)(u, v)=∫R2de−2πµx⋅uf(x, y)e−2πνx⋅udxdy, (128)
which is called steerable quaternion FT, can be found in [99]. Using the splitting method of the quaternion signal,
(128) can be written in the following complex form
Fµ,ν(f)(u, v)=Fµ,ν(f−)(u, v)+Fµ,ν(f+)(u, v),
where
Fµ,ν(f±)=∫R2e2πµ(xu∓yv)f±dxdy.
Recall that Bebenko [12] first proved the sharp Hausdorff Youngs inequality for the complex FT in Rwith even
positive number qand later for the general case was proved by Beckner [35]. Using the Minkowski inequality, sharp

Hausdorff-Young inequality [35] for the complex FT and the modulus identities ∣f(x, y)∣2=∣f−(x, y)∣2+∣f+(x, y)∣2and
∣Fµ,ν(f)(u, v)∣2=∣Fµ,ν(f−)(u, v)∣2+∣Fµ,ν(f+)(u, v)∣2,which was first proved for µ=i, ν=jin [98], Lian [125] proved
the sharp Hausdorff Young inequality for the quaternion FT as
∥Fµ,νf∥Lq

pappearing in the inequality (129) is sharp as
can be seen that choosing one of f±to be zero Fµ,νreduces to the complex FT and A2
pserves as a sharp constant in the
Hausdorff-Young inequality for the complex FT [35]. Using the relation Fl(f)=Fs˜fand using the sharp inequality
(129), Lian [125] also obtained the sharp Hausdorff Young inequality, with the same assumption on pandf,for the
left-sided quaternion FT as ∥Fl(f)∥Lq
H(R2)≤A2
p∥˜f∥Lp
H(R2),where ˜f(x, y)=f0(x, y)+if1(x,−y)+jf2(x, y)+kf3(x,−y).
The norms ∥⋅∥Lp
H(R2)and∥˜⋅∥Lp
H(R2)are equivalent but they are not in general equal. However ∥f∥L2
H(R2)=∥˜f∥L2
H(R2).
Uncertainty Principles: The UP describes a feature of a function and its quaternion FT. Beckner [36] has shown
that sharp Pitt’s inequality yields a short proof of a logarithmic uncertainty estimate, and Heisenberg-Weyl’s inequality
follows by using logarithmic inequality. In [36], with the aid of rearrangement and symmetrization, Beckner has proved
a sharp Pitt’s inequality by applying the sharp L1Young’s inequality for convolution on R+.As in [37], based on
Young’s inequality for the convolution on R+×S2d−1,Chen et al. [51] gave a different proof of the Pitt’s inequality for
QFT. They obtained the Pitt’s inequality
∫R2d∣ξ∣−α∣ˆf(ξ)∣2dξ≤Cα∫R2d∣x∣α∣f(x)∣2dx (130)
forf∈S(R2d,R),0≤α≤2d,where Cα=πα[Γ(2d−α
4)/Γ(2d+α
4)]. Using (130), (126) they established the Pitt’s
inequality for the quaternion valued function f∈S(R2d,H)as
∫R2d∣ξ∣−α∣ˆf(ξ)∣2
Qdξ≤Cα∫R2d∣x∣α∣f(x)∣2dx. (131)
By differentiating the sharp Pitt’s inequality at α=0,they also gave the logarithmic UP as
∫R2dln∣x∣∣f(x)∣2dx+∫R2dln∣ξ∣∣f(ξ)∣2
Qdξ≥D∫R2d∣f(x)∣2dx, (132)
D=ψ(2d
4)−ln(π)andψ=d
dt[ln Γ(t)].The Heisenberg-Weyl’s UP for f∈L2
H(R2d),with∥f∥2
2=1 is
∆fx⋅∆fξ≥d
2π, (133)
where the standard deviations ∆ fx=(∫R2d∣x−x0∣2∣f(x)∣2dx)1

Qdξ)2d
l=1,ξ=(ξ1, ξ2,⋯, ξ2d)
respectively is obtained in [51]. The inequality (133) is based on the interpretation of the standard deviation as the
size of the essential support of f.With the different notion of the support gives different version of the UP like, for a
non-zero function f∈L2
H(R2d)which is ϵT−concentrated on a measurable set T⊂R2dand ˆfisϵΩ−concentrated on a
measurable set Ω ⊂R2d,
∣T∣∣Ω∣≥(1−ϵt−ϵΩ)2,
which is the Donoho-Stark’s UP, for an alternative proof see [117], [126]. It happens that if suppf⊂Tandsupp ˆf⊂Ω,
then∣T∣∣Ω∣≥1.In [117], authors discussed the recovery of a quaternion-valued signal in R2despite a significant amount
of missing information. Like, say, if a signal f∈L2
H(R2)is transmitted to a receiver who knows that it is bandlimited,
meaning that fwas synthesized using only frequencies in a set Ω ⊂R2.Now, suppose that the receiver is unable to
observe all the data of f,a certain subset Tofx−values is unobserved. Moreover, the observed signal is contaminated
by observational noise n(x)∈L2
H(R2).Thus the received signal r(x)∈L2
H(R2)satisfies
r(x)=⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩f(x)+n(x),x∉T,
0, x∈T.
The receiver’s aim is to reconstruct the transmitted signal ffrom the noisy received signal r(x).Although it may
seem that information about fforx∈Tis unavailable, the UPs say that the recovery is possible provided that
24
∣T∣∣Ω∣<1.Donoho and Stark first proved this result [63] in the classical Fourier domain for the function on R.Some
generalizations of the Donoho-Stark UP for the right-sided QFT have been studied in [1].
The following result, in [51], is a generalization in the quaternion setting of the result due to Benedicks [39] (also
see [71]) for ordinary FT whose elegant proof was first circulated as a preprint in 1974 but not formally published for
another decade.
Iff∈L1
H(R2d)with suppf⊂Tandsupp ˆf⊂Ω such that ∣T∣∣Ω∣<∞,then f=0. (134)
Note that if f∈Lp
H(R2d)(p>1)and∣T∣<∞,then f∈L1
H(R2d)by Holder’s inequality and if f∈L1
H(R2d)and
∣Ω∣<∞then f∈Lp
H(R2d)for all p>1 hence the result (134) applies equally to Lp
H(R2d)functions. The proof of
the result (134) relies on the Poisson summation formula for the quaternion valued function, i.e., if f∈L1
H(R2d),
the series ϕ(x1, x2)=∑
(k1,k2)∈Z2df(x1+k1, x2+k2)converges in L1
H([0,1]2d),then the quaternion Fourier series of
ϕis∑
(k1,k2)∈Z2de2πik1⋅x1ˆf(k1, k2)e2πjk2⋅x2.The local uncertainty inequalities for the classical FT, which states that if
f∈L2(Rd,C)is highly localized then its FT can be concentrated in a small neighborhood of two or more separated
points, was first obtained by Faris [70] and sharper by Price [163], [162]. Lian [126] obtained the local UP for the
two-sided QFT as
∫E∣(Ff)(x)∣2dx≤Kλ∣E∣λ∥∣x∣λf∥2
2,0<λ<1 (135)
and
∫E∣(Ff)(x)∣2dx≤Kλ∣E∣∥f∥2−2
λ
2∥∣x∣λf∥2
λ
2, λ>1 (136)
for all f∈L2
H(R2)and all measurable E⊂R2,where
Kλ=⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎩(1+λ)2

Using this local UP and following the lines of [75], one can get the global UP, which includes different powers of norm
as
∥∣x∣sf∥2β
s+β
L2
H(R2)⋅∥∣y∣βFf∥2s

L2
H(R2)≥Cs,β∥f∥2
L2
H(R2), (138)
where s, β>0, f∈L2
H(R2)andCs,βis some constant.
The Pitt’s inequality and the logarithmic UPs given in (131) and (132) are expressed in terms of the module given
by (126). Moreover, it was first proved for real-valued function under two-sided QFT following Beckner’s lines with
quite a lot of effort. Thus, a genuine analogues of Pitt’s inequality and the logarithmic UP for quaternion-valued
function on R2is obtained in [126], using the two-dimensional plane split of a quaternion and the results for the
complex FT, which are same as (131) and (132) respectively with the norm ∣⋅∣Qreplaced as ∣⋅∣,furthermore the
constant Din equation (132) is ψ(1)−ln(π).The method adopted by Lian [126] is easier and also applicable to the
one-sided QFT, general two-sided QFT or QFT on higher dimension Rd.Without using the sharp Hausdorff-Young’s
inequality of the two-sided QFT, Lian also obtained the Entropy UP
H(∣f∣2)+H(∣F(f)∣2)≥2(1−ln 2), (139)
forf∈S(R2,H)and∥f∥L2
H(R2)=1,where H(f)=−∫R2f(x)lnf(x)dx.
6.1 One dimensional quaternion Fourier transform
So far, we have seen that the quaternion FT was studied for the quaternion-valued function defined on RorR2d.The
quaternion FT for the quaternion-valued function defined on Rwas first defined by He et al. [93] as
ˆf(ξ)=ˆf1(ξ)+jˆf2(ξ) (140)
forf∈L2
H(R).They obtained the Parseval’s formula ⟨f, g⟩L2
H(R)=⟨f, g⟩L2
H(R),forf, g∈L2
H(R),and proved that
̂(f⋆g)(ξ)≠ˆf(ξ)ˆg(ξ)in general, for the convolution ⋆defined by
(f⋆g)(x)=∫Rf(x−x′)g(x′)dx′. (141)
25
Also if we take f=f1+jf2andg=g1+jg2,then we have
̂(f⋆g)(ξ)=[ˆf1(ξ)ˆg1(ξ)−ˆ¯f2(ξ)ˆg2(ξ)]+j[ˆf2(ξ)ˆg1(ξ)−ˆ¯f1(ξ)ˆg2(ξ)]
ˆf(ξ)ˆg(ξ)=[ˆf1(ξ)ˆg1(ξ)−¯ˆf2(ξ)ˆg2(ξ)]+j[ˆf2(ξ)ˆg1(ξ)−¯ˆf1(ξ)ˆg2(ξ)].
Thuŝ(f⋆g)(ξ)=ˆf(ξ)ˆg(ξ)if¯ˆf1(ξ)=ˆ¯f1(ξ)and¯ˆf2(ξ)=ˆ¯f2(ξ).Bahri et al. [33] also studied one-dimensional quaternion
FT with some convolution ⋆for which f⋆g≠g⋆fin general and also faces the same problem as that in [93]. Akila
et al. [5] introduced a novel natural convolution given as
(f⍟g)(x)=(f1⋆g1)(x)−(ˇf2⋆g2)(x)+j((ˇf1⋆g2)(x)+(f2⋆g1)(x)) (142)
and proved that f⍟δ∈Lp
H(R), α(f⍟g)=(αf)⍟g,(f+g)⍟δ=f⍟δ+g⍟δand(f⍟g)⍟ϵ=f⍟(δ⍟ϵ)for all α∈H,
δ, ϵ∈L1
H(R),andf∈Lp
H(R), p=1,2.They also proved the convolution theorem F(f⍟g)=F(f)F(δ), δ∈L1
H(R)
andf∈L2
H(R),and hence ⍟defined in (142) serves as a better convolution structure for the transform defined in
(140) than the one given in (141) and also in [33]. In general, ⍟is non-commutative, i.e., f⍟gneed not be equal to
g⍟f.If both fandgare complex-valued or if one of them is a real-valued even function, then we get f⍟g=g⍟f.
Finding a suitable non-trivial necessary and sufficient condition on fandgto get f⋆g=g⋆fis still and interesting
open problem. The definition (140) together with the convolution structure (142) and its properties for the arbitrary
dimension d,i.e., for the functions defined on Rdcan be found in [6].
7 Quaternion Fractional Fourier Transform (QFrFT)
Guanlei et al. [77] proposed a definition of two-sided QFrFT. It extends the definition of classical FrFT for the complex-
valued function to that of the quaternion-valued functions. This transform is a natural extension of the two-sided
QFT (122). The idea of defining the transform is by replacing the Fourier kernel in (122) with that of the fractional
Fourier kernel. Thus the definition of the two-sided QFrFT for the function f∈L2
H(R)is defined by
(Fij
α,βf)(u1, u2)=∫R2Ki
α(x1, u1)f(x1, x2)Kj
β(x2, u2)dx1dx2, (143)
where Ki
α(x1, u1)=√

1−jcotα
2πej(x2

2tanα−x2u2

andα, β≠nπ, n∈Z.In
particular, the QFrFT (143), reduces to QFT for α=β=π
2,reduces to the classical 1 −DFT of f(x1, x2)for variable
x1,when α=π
2andβ=0,reduces to the 1 −DFT of f(x1, x2)for variable x2.Moreover, the transform (143) is such that
it has the property that (Fij
α,βf)(u1, u2)=f(x1, x2)for(α, β)=(0,0)or(2π,2π)and(Fij
π,πf)(u1, u2)=f(−x1,−x2),
(Fij
3π
2,3π
2f)(u1, u2)=(Fsf)(−u1,−u2),where Fsis a two sided QFrFT given by (122). Authors in [77], obtained the
R−linear property, odd-even invariant property, i.e., (Fij
α,βf(ϵ1x1, ϵ2x2))(u1, u2)=(Fij
α,βf)(ϵ1u1, ϵ2u2), ϵl=±1, l=
1,2 and also the additivity property, i.e., Fij
α1,β1Fij
α2,β2=Fij
α1+α2,β1+β2of the transform (143). Wei et al. [203], obtained
the inversion formula for the transform (143) as
f(x1, x2)=∫R2Ki
−α(x1, u1)(Fij
α,βf)(u1, u2)Kj
−β(x2, u2)du1du2,
and proved the Parseval’s formula ⟨Fij
α,βf,Fij
α,βg⟩=⟨f, g⟩, f, g∈L2
H(R)with respect to the scalar product (9). In
particular, when f=g,it follows that ∥Fij
α,βf∥L2
H(R)=∥f∥L2
H(R).From the signal processing point of view, the Parseval’s
formula states that the signal energy is preserved by the transform (143). It can be seen that it is not possible to
establish a general Parseval’s formula for the inner product given by (8) because it lacks the cyclic symmetry (1).
Thus, to obtain such Parseval’s formula, it is therefore either necessary to modify the symmetric property of the inner
product as in (9) or to modify the QFrFT itself. Thus, author in [203] gave the definition of right-sided QFrFT
(Qij
α,βf)(u1, u2)=∫R2f(x1, x2)Ki
α(x1, u1)Kj
β(x2, u2)dx1dx2. (144)
The transform enjoys the property (Qij
α,βf,Qij
α,βg)=(f, g), f, g∈L2
H(R)according to the inner product (8), as a
consequence of which it follows that ∥Qij
α,βf∥L2
H(R)=∥f∥L2
H(R).In what follows, we see the progress of the FrFT for
the quaternion-valued function defined on R.
26
Using the idea of He et al. [93], Roopkumar [170] gave the definition of FrFT of type II of quaternion-valued
function f=f1+jf2∈L2
H(R)as
(Fαf)(ξ)=(Fαf1)(ξ)+j(Fαf2)(ξ), (145)
where Fαfl, l=1,2 is the classical FrFT. The transform (145) is H−linear satisfying the property FαFβf=Fα+βf,
forf∈L2
H(R).Apart from this, the transform also satisfies the following Parseval’s identity
(Fαf,Fαg)=(f, g), f, g∈L2
H(R), (146)
where(⋅,⋅)denotes the inner product given by (8). Motivated by the idea of defining the convolution of one-dimensional
quaternion-valued function for the QFT given in (142), author in [170] defined the convolution associated with the
QFrFT as
(f⍟αg)(x)=(f1⋆αg1)(x)−(F−2αf2⋆αg2)(x)+j((F−2αf1⋆αg2)(x)+(f2⋆αg1)(x)), (147)
where⋆αis the convolution for the complex valued function given by (f1⋆αg1)(x)=cα√
2πe−iaαx2(˜f1⋆˜g1)(x),where
˜f1(x)=f1(x)eiaαx2, cα=√
1−icotα, a α=cotα
2and⋆is the classical convolution given as (f1⋆g1)(x)=∫Rf1(x−
y)g(y)dy.Also, they considered the following operation between two quaternion-valued functions as
(f⊗αg)(x)=(f1⋆′
αg1)(x)−(F−2αf2⋆′
αg2)(x)+j((F−2αf1⋆′
αg2)(x)+(f2⋆′
αg1)(x)), (148)
where⋆′
αis the operation defined on complex valued functions as (f1⋆′
αg1)(x)=1√
2πeiaαx2(˜˜f1⋆˜˜g1)(x),where
˜˜f1(x)=f1(x)e−iaαx2.For the convolution (147) and the operation (148), author in [170] obtained the convolution and
product theorem given respectively as (Fα(f⍟αg))(ξ)=(Fαf)(ξ)(Fαg)(ξ)e−iaαξ2andFα(˜˜(fg))=c−α[Fαf⊗αFαg]
forf∈L2
H(R), g∈L1
H(R).For the convolution (147), with ⋆αfor the complex valued functions given by (f1⋆αg1)(x)=
e−iaαx2(˜f1⋆g1)(x),author in [169] proved that for f∈L2
H(R)andg∈L2
H(R)f⍟αg∈L2
H(R)and obtained the
convolution theorem for the transform (145) as
(Fα(f⍟αg))(ξ)=√
2π(Fαf)(ξ)(Fαg)(ξcscα). (149)
They proved that the convolution ⍟αsatisfies the properties analogue to those for the convolution ⍟given in (142),
like(f+h)⍟αg=f⍟αg+h⍟αgand(γf)⍟αg=γ(f⍟αg),forf, h∈L2
H(R), g∈L1
H(R)andγ∈H.Motivated by
He et al. [93] and Roopkumar [170], Gupta et al. [89] extended the FrFT [188] for the complex-valued functions to
the quaternion-valued function. They called the transform as the QFrFT and is defined for f=f1+jf2∈L2
H(R)and
0<θ≤1 as
Fθf=Fθf1+jFθf2, (150)
where(Fθg)(ξ)=∫Rg(t)e−i(sgnξ)∣ξ∣1
θtdtforg∈L2
C(R)is the FrFT given in [188]. They proved that the trans-
form (150) is H−linear and using the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma and the Parseval’s formula for the classical case
author proved the same for the quaternion case i.e., lim ∣ξ∣→∞∣(Fθf)(ξ)∣=0,forf∈L1

for the QFrFT (150) is given by Fθ(f⊗g)=(Fθf)(Fθg),forf∈L2
H(R), g∈L1
H(R).Authors in [89] also obtained the
Heisenberg type UP for the QFrFT (150) as

for the function f=f1+jf2such the fl, l=1,2 are in the Schwartz class.
8 Quaternion Linear Canonical Transform (QLCT)
The LCT has a degree of freedom and is more flexible than the FT and the FrFT, with similar computational costs.
Thus, because of these advantages, the LCT has been extended to the quaternion algebra framework. This leads to the
notion of the QLCT; furthermore, because of the non-commutativity of the quaternion multiplication, there are three
different types of QLCTs, namely right-sided, two-sided, and left-sided QLCT. The following are their definitions of
27
right-sided, left-sided, and two-sided QLCT, respectively, which are obtained by replacing the kernels of the FT with
that of the kernels of LCT

Parseval theorem for the QFT, Hitzer [97] modified the inner product to be the scalar inner product, while Chen [51]
developed a strategy applying the Q−modules, i.e., (126), of QFT to define the Lp,i.e., (127) to prove the Parseval
formula. Bahri [15] obtained the relation between any two transforms given by (152),(153) and (154). Adopting the
method of Chen [51], Kou et al. [114] considered the following symmetrical representation

M1,M2f=Lij

Uncertainty Principles: By differentiating the Pitt’s inequality given by (163) for LCT of 2D function, Kundu et

M3,M4{f}(t1, t2)is the inverse two-
sided quaternion LCT of LH
M1,M2{f}(u1, u2)with the parameters M5, M6.The function g(t1, t2)serves as a bridge
to obtain the functional relation between LH
M1,M2{f}(u1, u2)andLH
M3,M4{f}(t1, t2).Note that this sort of relation is
only available for the two-sided quaternion LCT. Relations (171) and (172) are important, as they help in obtaining
several UPs using the same for the quaternion FT. For f∈L1
H(R2)∩L2
H(R2)with unit energy, they obtained the
UP, which presents lower bounds for the product of the spread of the quaternion-valued function in two different
quaternion linear canonical domains, as

F=1.Using the relation (171) and the Hausdorff-Young inequality for the two-sided quaternion FT, Zhu et al. [228]
introduced the Hausdorff-Young inequality for the quaternion LCT in two linear canonical domain as

where Kλis given by (137) and b=(b5, b6).The inequalities given by equations (173),(173),(175),(176),(177) and (178)
reduces to the corresponding UP for the two-sided quaternion LCT in the spatial and frequency domain when the
parameters M5=M1, M6=M2which yields M3=M4=(1,0,0,1),if further M1=(0,1,0,−1)=M2=(0,1,0,−1)then
these inequalities leads to the corresponding uncertainty inequalities for the two-sided quaternion FT. Even though
the standard deviation is widely accepted as a measure of uncertainty, it is not an ideal tool to express UP in some
situations; some examples are cited in [42] to express limitations on the use of standard deviation. Thus, entropy was
proposed by Shannon and R` enyi. In particular, R` enyi entropy is one parameter extension of Shannon entropy.
Definition 8.1. (R` enyi entropy) The entropy of a probability density function PonR2is defined by
Hα(P)=1
1−αln(∫R2[P(t)]αdt), α≥1.
When α→1,R` enyi entropy leads to Shannon entropy, given by E(P)=−∫R2ln(P(t))P(t)dt.
Using the Hausdorff-Young inequality (174), the R` enyi UPs for the two-sided quaternion LCT in different linear
canonical domains are obtained in [228] as

M1,M2f(u)∣2)≥2+2 lnπ+ln∣b5b6∣, (180)
in two different linear canonical domain. Equations (179) and (180) reduces to the corresponding UPs for the quater-
nion LCT in the spatial and frequency domain when M5=M1, M6=M2and to that of the quaternion FT, if further
M3=M4=(1,0,0,1).
9 Quaternion Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform (QQPFT)
Recently, Gupta and Verma [88] extended QPFT (87) to the quaternion-valued functions. They defined the two-sided
quaternion quadratic phase FT by replacing the kernels Ki(t1, ξ1)=1√
2πe−it1,ξ1andKj(t2, ξ2)=1√
2πe−jt2,ξ2,in the
definition
(FHf)(ξ)=∫R2Ki(t1, ξ1)f(t)Kj(t2, ξ2)dt,ξ=(ξ1, ξ2)∈R2, (181)
of two-sided quaternion FT by the kernels in the quadratic phase FT given in (88) as

f(t)=∣B1B2∣∫R2Ki∧1(t1, ξ1)(Q∧1,∧2

proved the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma i.e., lim ∣ξl∣→∞∣(Q∧1,∧2

Hausdorff-Youngs inequality, authors also obtained the translation formula given by

16π2∣B1B2∣),when α→1 and β→1.It is to be noted that the Hausdorff-
Youngs inequality (187), obtained in the [88] is more sharper than the one obtained in [214]. Based on the relationship
between QQPFT and the QFT and using the Heisenberg’s and logarithmic UP for the QFT, authors in [214] (and
also [19]) obtained the Heisenberg’s UP for the transform(1)Q∧1,∧2
Hgiven as

for the functions f∈S(R2,H),where D=ln(2π2)−2ψ(1

dt(ln(Γ(t))).In fact, a more general version of the
Heisenberg UP for Q∧1,∧2
Hcan be found in [19]. Apart from these UPs, authors in [214] also obtained the Hardy’s
UP and Beurling’s UP for the transform(1)Q∧1,∧2
H,using the same for the QFT. Using the relation between(1)Q∧1,∧2
H
and the QFT and its associated Donoho-Stark’s UP authors also proved that, if a non-zero f∈L2
H(R2)isϵE1−
concentrated on E1⊂R2and(1)Q∧1,∧2
HfisϵE2−concentrated on E2⊂R2,then∣E1∣∣E2∣≥2π

called the Donoho-Stark’s UP for the QQPFT(1)Q∧1,∧2
H.
10 Windowed Fourier Transform (WFT)
It is well known that the representation of a function fofxis usually called its time representation, while its FT
ˆf(ξ)is called the frequency representation. From the application point of view, one often needs information regarding
the frequency behavior of a signal at a certain time and the time behavior at certain frequency components of a
signal. This leads to constructing several joint time-frequency representations like the Gabor transform, WT, ST,
Wigner distribution, etc. Other names for the Gabor transform that are frequently used in the literature are the
Weyl-Heisenberg transform, short-time FT, and WFT. The motivations for the development of the WT are of a
similar nature. However, it is preferably called the time-scale representation since the parameter ainvolved in its
definition cannot completely be identified with an inverse frequency, as it is often done in the literature.
Definition 10.1. The Gabor transform of f∈L2(R)with respect to the window function ψis defined by
(Gψf)(ω, t)=1√
2π∫Rf(x)ψ(x−t)e−iωxdx. (191)
Equivalently, (191) has several important forms. Before we write them, let us first mention some important
operators that we will be frequently using throughout the paper.
1.Translation operator: (τyψ)(x)=ψ(x−y), y∈R.
2.Dilation Operator(s): (δaψ)(x)=1√
∣a∣ψ(x
a)and(Daψ)(x)=∣a∣ψ(ax), a∈R0.
3.Modulation Operator: (Maψ)(x)=eiaxψ(x), a∈R.
Based on these operators, equation (191) can be written as
(Gψf)(ω, t)=1√
2π∫Rf(x)(τtψ)(x)e−iωxdx (192)
(Gψf)(ω, t)=1√
2π∫Rf(x)(Maτtψ)(x)dx (193)
(Gψf)(ω, t)=⟨f, ψω,t⟩L2(R), (194)
where ψω,t(x)=1√
2π(Maτtψ)(x)=1√
2πψ(x−t)eiωx.It is a matter of simple verification that Gψfis linear in fand
conjugate linear in ψ.The following properties, called the covariance properties of the WFT, give respectively the
formula for the WFT of the translation by x0and modulation by ω0of function fwith respect to the window function
ψ
[Gψ(τx0f)](ω, t)=e−iωx0(Gψf)(ω, t−x0) (195)
[Gψ(Mω0f)](ω, t)=(Gψf)(ω−ω0, t). (196)
Using (195) and (196), one can obtain [Gψ(Mω0τx0f)](ω, t)=e−iωx0(Gψf)(ω−ω0, t−x0),(ω, t)∈R2.
∫R2(Gψf)(ω, t)(Gψg)(ω, t)=∥ψ∥2
L2(R)⟨f, g⟩L2(R).
33
This in particular, for f=g,implies that ∥Gψf∥2
L2(R2)=∥ψ∥2
L2(R)∥f∥2
L2(R),which further shows that the normalized
WFT1
∥ψ∥L2(R)Gψis an isometry from L2(R)intoL2(R2).The WFT converts a function f(x)of one variable into a
function (Gψf)(ω, t)of two variables without changing the total energy. Also, Gψfis in L2(R2)forf∈L2(R),i.e.,
the range Gψ(L2(R))of WFT of square integrable functions is a subspace of L2(R2).In fact, it is a proper subspace
ofL2(R2),because ∣(Gψf)(ω, t)∣≤1√
2π∥f∥L2(R2)∥ψ∥L2(R2), ω, t∈Rimplies that Gψfis bounded, but L2(R2)contains
functions that are unbounded. Thus, square integrability of Gψfis a necessary condition but not sufficient. The range
Gψ(L2(R)),of bounded linear operator Gψf∶L2(R)→L2(R2)which is isometric upto some constant, is a closed
subspace. Being closed subspace of the Hilbert space L2(R2),Gψ(L2(R))is also a Hilbert space. Moreover, it is a
RKHS, with the kernel given by
Kψ(ω′, t′;ω, t)=1
∥ψ∥2
L2(R)⟨ψω,t, ψω′,t′⟩L2(R) (197)
which is pointwise bounded, i.e., ∣Kψ(ω′, t′;ω, t)∣≤1,∀(ω′, t′),(ω, t)∈R2.A strong inequality for the WFT, proved
by Lieb [127], often called Lieb’s inequality in the literature, for f, ψ∈L2(Rd)and 2≤p<∞as

where Vψffor the functions f, ψonRdare defined similar to equation (191).
Uncertainty Principles: Wilczok [209] proved that Gψfof a function f∈L2(R)∖{0}cannot have a support
of finite Lebesgue measure. The author also proved that the portion of Gψflying outside some set M⊂R2cannot
be arbitrarily small. For sufficiently small M,this fact is justified by the following theorem, which can be proved by
estimating the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of a suitably defined operator.
Theorem 10.1. (Concentration of Gψfon a small set) Let ψbe a window function and M⊂R2with λ(2)(M)<1.
Then, for f∈L2(R)arbitrary
∥Gψf−χM⋅Gψf∥L2(R2)≥∥ψ∥L2(R)(1−λ(2)(M)1
2)∥f∥L2(R). (200)
It is to be noted that the lower bound of ∥Gψf−χM⋅Gψf∥L2(R2)in (201) is larger the smaller λ(2)(M)is. However,
it can be seen that the above theorem requires the assumption that λ(2)(M)<1.So a more general result is established
with the assumption that Mis an arbitrary subset of R2with finite Lebesgue measure, i.e., for a given window function
ψandM⊂R2with λ(2)(M)<∞,there exists a constant CG
ψ,M>0 such that for f∈L2(R)arbitrary
∥Gψf−χM⋅Gψf∥L2(R2)≥CG
ψ,M∥f∥L2(R). (201)
This result was established by Wilczok [209] using the abstract result of Havin and J¨ oricke in [92]. However, the
author in [209] did not give an estimate for the constant CG
ψ,Minvolved in (201) by the measure of M.Motivated by
the idea of Singer [187] in the case of WT, Wilczok obtained a different class of UPs results for the comparing the
localization of fand ˆfwith the localization of the WFT regarded as function of one variable as
(∫R2ω2∣(Gψf)(ω, t)∣2dωdx)1

which are called the UPs of the Heisenberg type for the WFT in ωandt, respectively. Using (202) and (203) one gets
(∫R2ω2∣(Gψf)(ω, t)∣2dωdx)1
2(∫R2t2∣(Gψf)(ω, t)∣2dωdt)1

4∥ψ∥2
L2(R)∥f∥4
L2(R),which is
called the phase space uncertainty of WFT. It can be interpreted by saying that the better the phase space localization
34
of the pair (f,ˆf),the worse the phase space localization of the WFT (Gψf)(ω, t).The time-frequency resolution of
Gψfis limited by the Heisenberg UP for ψ,which is based on the interpretation of the standard deviations as the size
of the essential supports of ψand its Fourier transform. Donoho and Stark [76], [63] used the concept “ ϵ-concentrated”
to replace standard deviation and derived the UP that reads as
∣Ω∣∣Γ∣≥2π(1−ϵΩ−ϵΓ)2,
whenever a non-zero function f∈L2(R)isϵΩ−concentrated on Ω ⊂Rand its Fourier transform is ϵΓ−concentrated on
Γ⊂R.An analogous to which is given as
∣U∣≥(1−ϵ),
forf, ψ∈L2(Rd),with∥f∥L2(Rd)=∥ψ∥L2(Rd)=1,andU⊂R2dsuch that
∫ ∫U∣(Vψf)(x, ω)∣2dxdω≥1−ϵ, (204)

11 Wavelet Transform (WT)
In signal analysis, (Gϕf)(b, ξ)gives the time-frequency content of a signal fat time band frequency ξby placing the
window ϕat time b.The drawback here is that a window of fixed width is used for all time b.It is more accurate
and desirable if we have an adaptive window that gives a wide window for low frequency and a narrow one for high
frequency. This can be done using the WT.
Definition 11.1. A function ψ∈L2(R)∖{0}satisfying the admissibility condition
cψ=2π∫R∣ˆψ(ξ)∣2dξ
∣ξ∣<∞
is called a mother wavelet.
For a given mother wavelet ψand(a, b)∈R∗×R,the family ψa,b(x)=τbδaψ(x)=1√
∣a∣ψ(x−b
a)are called the
daughter wavelets.
Definition 11.2. The WT of f∈L2(R)with respect to the mother wavelet ψis defined by
(Wψf)(a, b)=∫Rf(x)1√
∣a∣ψ(x−b
a)dx. (205)
Equivalently, using the definition of translation and the dilation operator in 1 and 2 respectively, (205) has several
important forms. Like
(Wψf)(a, b)=∫Rf(x)τbδaψ(x)dx. (206)
and
(Wψf)(a, b)=⟨f, ψa,b⟩L2(R). (207)
Another important, equivalent form of the definition of the WT (205) is in terms of the convolution given by
(Wψf)(a, b)=(f⋆δa˜ψ)(b), (208)
35
where ˜ψ(t)=ψ(−t).It is a matter of simple verification that Wψfis linear in fand conjugate linear in ψ.The
following properties, called the covariance properties of the WT, give the formula for the WT of the translation by x0
and dilation by c∈R∗of the function fwith respect to ψ
[(Wψ(τx0f)](a, b)=(Wψf)(a, b−x0)
and
[(Wψ(δcf)](a, b)=(Wψf)(a
c,b
c).
The transform (205), satisfies the following inner product relations
∫R∫R(Wψf)(a, b)(Wψg)(a, b)dadb
a2=cψ⟨f, g⟩L2(R)
This in particular, for f=g,implies that ∥Wψf∥2
L2(R∗×R,dadb
a2)=cψ∥f∥2
L2(R),which further shows that the operator
1√cψWψis an isometry from L2(R)intoL2(R∗×R, dµaff),where dµaff=dadb
a2denotes the so called affine measure.
The WT converts a function f(x)of one variable into a function (Gψf)(a, b)of two variables without changing the
total energy. Also, the Wψfis in L2(R∗×R,dadb
a2)forf∈L2(R),i.e., the space of all WFT of square-integrable
functions Wψ(L2(R))is a subspace of L2(R∗×R,dadb
a2).In fact, it is a proper subspace because ∣(Wψf)(a, b)∣≤
∥f∥L2(R2)∥ψ∥L2(R2),(a, b)∈R∗×Rimplies that Wψfis bounded, but L2(R∗×R,dadb
a2)contains functions that are
unbounded. Thus, the belongingness of Wψf∈L2(R∗×R,dadb
a2)is necessary condition but not sufficient. The range
Wψ(L2(R)),of bounded linear operator Gψf∶L2(R)→L2(R∗×R,dadb
a2)which is isometric upto some constant, is
a closed subspace. Being closed subspace of the Hilbert space L2(R∗×R,dadb
a2),Gψ(L2(R))is also a Hilbert space.
Moreover, it is a RKHS, with the kernel given by
Kψ(a′, b′;a, b)=1
cψ⟨ψa,b, ψa′,b′⟩L2(R).
The kernel is pointwise bounded, i.e., ∣Kψ(a′, b′;a, b)∣≤∥ψ∥2
L2(R)
cψ,∀(a′, b′),(a, b)∈R∗×R.
Definition 11.3. A function f∈L2(Rn)is a window function if it satisfies the conditions xl1xl2⋯xlrf(x)∈L2(Rn),
for all possible choices of l1, l2,⋅, lr∈{1,2,⋯, n},with r∈{1,2,⋯, n}where l1, l2,⋅, lrare all different. In particular,
ifn=2,then we say that f∈L2(R2)is a window function if x1f(x), x2f(x)andx1x2f(x)∈L2(R2).For example
ψ(x)=x1x2⋯xne−(x2
1+x2
2+⋯+x2
n)is a window function.
A function f∈L2(Rn)is a basic wavelet if it satisfies the following admissibility condition
∫Rn∣ˆψ(ξ)∣2
∣ξ∣pdξ<∞. (209)
Iff∈L2(Rn)be a window function then f∈L1(Rn),this can be proved using the notion of pseudo-orthants [146].
Pandey et al. [145] proved that a window function ψ∈L2(Rn)satisfies the admissibility condition (209) if and only if
∫Rψ(x1, x2,⋯, xn)dxl, l=1,2,⋯, n.Some examples of window functions that are wavelets are Πn
i=1xie−x2
iand Πn
i=1xi

Pandey et al. [150] defined the WT of f∈L2(Rn)with respect to the basic wavelet ψ∈L2(Rn)by
(Wψf)(b,a)=⟨f(x),1√
∣a∣pψ(x−b
a)⟩ (210)
and proved that
∫Rn∫Rn(Wψf)(b,a)(Wψg)(b,a)dadb
∣a∣2p=Cψ⟨f, g⟩for all f, g∈L2(Rn) (211)
followed by the inversion formula is
f=1
Cψ∫Rn∫Rn(Wψf)(a,b)∣a∣−1

∣a∣2p, (212)
36
where Cψ=(2π)n∫Rn∣ˆψ(ξ)∣2
∣ξ∣pdξand∣a∣p=∣a1a2⋯an∣.The convergence in (212) is interpreted in the L2(Rn)sense.
Moreover, the convergence of the inversion formula (212) is pointwise at all the points of continuity of f.It is to
be noted that the parameter awas taken to be (a1, a2,⋯, an)where the wavelet ψis not spherically symmetric
in [146], [145] which was not the case in Daubechies [57], they took a=(a, a,⋯, a),with a>0 and the wavelet ψas
spherically symmetric to obtain
∫∞
0da
an+1∫∞
−∞db(Twavf)(a,b)(Twavg)(a,b)=Cψ⟨f, g⟩ (213)
and
f=C−1
ψ∫∞
−∞db(Twavf)(a,b)ψa,b, (214)
where ψa,b(x)=a−n
2ψ(x−b
a)and(Twavf)(a,b)=⟨f, ψa,b⟩is the WT of f∈L2(Rn)with respect to the spherically
symmetric function ψ∈L2(Rn)satisfying the condition Cψ=(2π)n∫∞
0dt
t∣η(t)∣2<∞and ˆψ(ξ)=η(∣ξ∣)for some η,
which is possible to choose because ψis spherically symmetric. Recently, Pandey et al. [148] defined the continuous WT
of tempered distribution f∈S′(Rn)with the wavelet kernel ψ∈S(Rn).It is to be noted that a function in ψ∈S(Rn)
is naturally a window function, as per the definition given in [145]. So it satisfied the admissible condition (209) if
and only if its integral with respect to each variable x1, x2,⋯, xnalong the real line vanishes. Let s(Rn)contains all
the wavelets in S(Rn).For the distribution f∈S′(Rn)and the wavelet ψ∈s(Rn),the WT is defined in [148](also
see [151]) with the corresponding inversion formula, where the convergence is interpreted in the weak topology of
S′(Rn).They found that the WT of a constant distribution is zero and that the inversion formula is not true for a
constant distribution but is true for a non-constant distribution which is not the sum of a non-constant distribution and
a non-zero constant distribution. Pandey [147] considered the distribution space D′
L2(Rn),where DL2(Rn)consists
ofC∞(Rn)function whose every derivative is in L2(Rn)and is equipped with a topology generated by a separating
family of semi-norms {γk}∞
∣k∣=0given by γk(ϕ)=∥ϕ(k)∥L2(Rn)forϕ∈DL2(Rn).They defined the WT of generalized
functions in D′
L2(Rn)which respect to the wavelet ψ(x)which are functions DL2(Rn)∩DL1(Rn)with the property
∫Rψ(x)dxl=0, l=1,2,⋯, nand∫Rψ(x)dx≠0,where xm=xm1
1xm2
2⋯xmnn,m=(m1, m2,⋯, mn), m1, m2,⋯, mn≥1
also obtained the corresponding inversion formula with the convergence interpreted in the weak distributional sense.
The space D′
L2(Rn)does not contain a non-zero constant, so it does not encounter a problem as seen with the WT
of distribution in the space D′(Rn)with respect to the wavelet ϕinDsatisfying the property that all its moments
along the real lines are non-zero [149], i.e., two functions having the same WT may differ by the constant.
Rieder [168] extended the WT Lψf(b, a)∶=1
Cψ⟨τbδaψ, f⟩0to the Sobolev spaces Hα(R), α∈R,consisting of the
tempered distribution having a regular and with respect to the weight (1+ω2)αsquare integrable FT, and interpreted
its image as subset of the fiber space Fα∶=L2((R0,da
a2), Hα(R)),which consists of functions ϕ∈Hα(R)such that
∫R0∥ϕ∥2
αda
a2<∞.This space is isomorphic to the tensor product L2(R0,da
a2)⊗Hα(R)as well as the Sobolev space
of two variables H0,α(R2,dadb
a2).Using the density of the Schwartz function in Hα(R),author proved that the for a
fixed a,and an integrable and admissible ψ, L ψf(⋅, a)is a continuous mapping from Hα(R)to itself. Moreover, the
operator Lψis an isometry from Hα(R)to the space Fα,i.e.,
∥Lψf∥Fα=(∫R∥Lψf(⋅, a)∥2
Hα(R)da
a2)1

and Range (Lψ)⊂Fαis a Hilbert space with the reproducing kernel P(˜b,˜a, b, a)=1√
Cψ(Lψψ)(˜b−b
a,˜a
a).The
Hs−distance of two WT with different admissible and integrable ψandϕof different argument function fandg
inHs(R)respectively were obtained to study the dependence of the transform on its wavelets and its argument as
∥(Lψf)(a,⋅)−(Lϕg)(a,⋅)∥Hs(R)≤∣a∣1

Perrier et al. [153] extended the WT to the Lp(R)spaces to characterize the Besov spaces Bα,q
p(R)by the behavior
at the small scale of the wavelet coefficient.

Chuong et al. [54] proved that for any a≠0 and any basis wavelet ψ,with the assumption that ψis integrable,
the operator Wψ∶H1(Rn)→H1(Rn)given by f→(Wψf)(a,⋅)are bounded such that ∥(Wψf)(a,⋅)∥H1(Rn)≤

Similar result was also obtained with the same estimates of the bound in the case of the Besov space Bα,q
p(Rn),
bounded mean oscillation space BMO(Rn)and the V MO(Rn)space with the norm replaced with the corresponding
norm and the basic wavelet compactly supported in the case of BMO(Rn)andV MO(Rn)spaces. We discuss these
results for the weighted Besov spaces and the weighted BMO spaces associated with a tempered weight function.
Let us recall the definitions of the weighted Besov spaces and the weighted BMO spaces associated with a tempered
weight function, which was proposed by H¨ ormander to study the theory of partial differential equations, i.e., a positive
function kdefined in Rnfor which there exist M, N>0 such that k(x+y)≤(1+M∣x∣)Nk(y),∀x,y∈Rn.For example,
k(x)=(1+∣x∣2)s
2,for every s∈R.We start with the following definitions.
Definition 11.5. The weighted Lebesgue space Lp
k(Rn),1≤p<∞is the space of all measurable functions on Rn
such that ∥f∥p,k=(∫Rn∣f(x)∣pk(x)dx)1
p<∞.

p,k=∥f∥p,k+∥∣h∣−αwp,k(f,h)∥∞,
where wp,k(f,h)=∥f(⋅+h)−f(⋅)∥p,k.
Definition 11.7. The weighted bounded mean oscillation space BMO k(Rn)is defined as the space of all functions
f∈L1,k

longing to a ball of radius rwith center at the origin, the operator Wψ∶Bα,q

Uncertainty Principles: Wilczok [209] proved that Wψfof a function f∈L2(R)∖{0}cannot have a support of
finite affine measure. The author also proved that the portion of Wψflying outside some set M⊂R2cannot be
arbitrarily small. For sufficiently small M,this fact is justified by the following theorem, which can be proved by
estimating the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of a suitably defined operator.
Theorem 11.1. (Concentration of Wψfon a small set) Let ψbe a window function and M⊂R∗×Rwith the
assumption∥ψ∥L2(R)√cψµaff(M)1
2<1.Then, for f∈L2(R)arbitrary

a2)≥√cψ⎛
⎝1−∥ψ∥L2(R)√cψµaff(M)1
2⎞
⎠∥f∥L2(R). (220)
It is to be noted that the lower bound of ∥Wψf−χM⋅Wψf∥L2(R2)in (221) is larger the smaller µaff(M)is. However,
it can be seen that the above theorem requires the assumption that∥ψ∥L2(R)√cψµaff(M)1
2<1.So a more general result
is established with the assumption that Mis an arbitrary subset of R∗×Rwith finite affine measure µaff, i.e., for a
given ψandM⊂R∗×Rwith µaff(M)<∞,there exists a constant CW
ψ,M>0 such that for f∈L2(R)arbitrary
∥Wψf−χM⋅Wψf∥L2(R2)≥CW
ψ,M∥f∥L2(R). (221)
This result was established by Wilczok [209] using the abstract result of Havin and J¨ oricke [92]. However, the author
in [209] did not give an estimate for the constant CW
ψ,Minvolved in (221) by the measure of M.Motivated by the idea
of Singer [187] in the case of WT, Wilczok obtained a different class of UPs results for the comparing the localization
offand ˆfwith the localization of the WT regarded as function of one variable as

12 Stockwell Transform (ST)
The S transform, also known as the ST in the literature, was first introduced by Stockwell et al. [193] in 1996. This
transform is basically an extension of the ideas of the continuous WT, which is based on a moving and scalable
localization Gaussian window and is defined as
(Sf)(τ, ξ)=∫∞
−∞f(t)∣ξ∣√
2πe−(τ−t)2ξ2
2e−i2πξtdt. (224)
One can infer from (224) that the width of the window function e−(τ−t)2ξ2
2shrinks as the analyzed frequency increases
and provides a better time localization for high frequencies. This transform was introduced to provide frequency-
dependent resolution while maintaining a direct relationship with the Fourier spectrum, which was absent in the
continuous WT. The advantage of these transforms is due to the fact that the modulation sinusoidal is fixed with
respect to the time axis, whereas the localizing scalable Gaussian window dilates and translates. If f∈L2(R),then
the ST given in equation (224) can be given in the Fourier domain as
(Sf)(τ, ξ)=e−2πiξτ∫∞
−∞ˆf(v)e−2π2(v−ξ)2
ξ2ei2πξτdv, τ∈R, ξ∈R0. (225)
Thus, the ST can be obtained as the Fourier multiplier F−1e−2π2(⋅−ξ)2
ξ2Ffollowed by a modulation for non zero frequency
ξ,here(Ff)(ξ)=∫Rf(t)e−2πitξdt.Moreover, the ST satisfy the property ASf=ˆf, f∈L2(R),where Ais called the
time average operator defined by
(AF)(ξ)=∫RF(τ, ξ)dτ, ξ∈R (226)
39
for the measurable function F∶R×R→C,whenever the integral exists. As a result of which we have the inversion
formula f=F−1ASf,for all f∈L2(R),i.e.,
f(t)=∫Re2πitξ(∫R(Sf)(τ, ξ))dξ, t∈R (227)
and also the Plancherel theorem for the ST as ∫R∣∫R(Sf)(τ, ξ)dτ∣2dξ=∥f∥2
L2(R).Wong et al. [210] considered the
function space M={F∶R×R→C∶∫R∣∫RF(τ, ξ)dτ∣2dξ},which is indefinite Hilbert space with the indefinite inner
product ⟨,⟩Mgiven by ⟨F, G⟩M=⟨AF, AG ⟩L2(R), F, G∈M,where AFis the average-time of Fgiven by (226). It is
to be noted that ⟨,⟩Mis indefinite in the sense that there exist nonzero F∈Msuch that ⟨F, F⟩M=0.They proved
that the range R(S)of the ST S∶L2(R2)→Mis a Hilbert space with respect to the inner product ⟨,⟩M.In fact, S
is an isometry from L2(R)onto R(S).As a consequence of ASf=ˆfand the Plancherel theorem for the ST, its range
R(S)is characterized in [210] as R(S)=M/Z,where Z={F∶R×R→C∶AF=0}.
The ST with the general window in the place of the Gaussian function in the definition given in [193] can be defined
below which is a hybrid of the Gabor transform and the WT
Definition 12.1. The ST of a function f∈L2(R)with respect to the window function φ∈L1(R)∩L2(R)is defined
by
(Sφf)(b, ξ)=∣ξ∣√
2π∫Re−ixξf(x)φ(ξ(x−b))dx, x∈R, ξ∈R0. (228)
Equivalently, using the definition of translation, dilation and the modulation operators in 1, 2 and 3 respectively,
(228) has several important forms.
(Sφf)(b, ξ)=∫Rf(x)MξτbDξφ(x)dx (229)
which can also be written in the form
(Sφf)(b, ξ)=1√
2π⟨f, φb,ξ⟩L2(R), (230)
where φb,ξ(x)=1√
2πMξτbDξφ(x).Another important, equivalent form of the definition of the WT (205) is in terms
of the convolution given by
(Sφf)(b, ξ)=1√
2π(M−ξf⋆Dξ˜φ)(b), (231)
where ˜ψ(t)=ψ(−t).It is a matter of simple verification that Sφfis linear in fand conjugate linear in φ.The ST Sφ
has been extended to a family of modified ST Ss
φfor 0<s≤∞in [84](also see [83]), which are defined as
(Ss
φf)(b, ξ)=1√
2π∣ξ∣1
s∫Re−ixξf(x)φ(ξ(x−b))dx (232)
=⟨f, φb,ξ
s⟩L2(R) (233)
where φb,ξ
s(x)=1√
2πMξτbDs
ξφ(x)andDs
ξφ(x)=∣ξ∣1
sφ(ξx).This family include the classical ST (224) when s=1 and
a variant of WT when s=2.The modified ST can be represented in the classical one as (Ss
φf)(b, ξ)=∣ξ∣−1
s′(Sφf)(b, ξ),
where1
s+1
s′=1.The modified ST satisfies the resolution of identity formula [84]
⟨f, g⟩L2(R)=1
cφ∫R(Ss
φf)(b, ξ)(Ssφg)(b, ξ)dbdξ
∣ξ∣1−1
s′, (234)
where φ∈L1(R)∩L2(R)is such that ∫Rφ(x)dx=1 and
cφ∶=∫R∣ˆφ(ξ−1)∣2
∣ξ∣dξ<∞, (235)
with ˆ φ(ξ)=1√
2π∫Re−ixξφ(x)dx, ξ∈R.The modified ST Ss
φ,0<s≤∞,forf∈L2(R)can be reconstructed from the
time-frequency representation Ss
φfusing the formula
f=1
cφ∫R∫R(Ss
φf)(b, ξ)φb,ξ

∣ξ∣1−2
s′. (236)
40
Fors=1,the resolution of identity formula (234) and the inversion formula (236) reduces to the one obtained by
Du et al. in [64]. Moreover, if φis a normalized window function such that cφ=1,then for all f, g∈L2(R),
⟨f, g⟩L2(R)=⟨Sφf,Sφg⟩L2(R×R0,dbdξ
∣ξ∣),which implied that the transform Sφf∈L2(R×R0,dbdξ
∣ξ∣),for all f∈L2(R)
and also ∥Sφf∥L2(R×R0,dbdξ
∣ξ∣)=∥f∥L2(R).Thus, the transform Sφis an isometry from L2(R)to the Hilbert space
L2(R×R0,dbdξ
∣ξ∣)with its range Sφ(L2(R))as a closed subspace. Furthermore, the range Sφ(L2(R))is a RKHS with
the kernel K(b, ξ;b′, ξ′)=(Sb,ξ
φφb,ξ)(b′, ξ′)=⟨φb′,ξ′, φb,ξ⟩,for(b, ξ),(b′ξ′)∈R×R0was proved in [102].
So far, we have considered the ST in one dimension. We now see the multidimensional ST and explore the results
that have been explored in the literature. For all ξ∈Rn,letAξ=(aij(ξ))1≤i,j≤nbe an invertible n×nreal matrix and
letφ∈L1(Rn)∩L2(Rn)be such that ∫Rnφ(x)dx=1.Then the n−dimensional ST Sφfoff∈L2(Rn)with respect to
the window function φis given by Riba et al. [167] as
(Sφf)(b,ξ)=(2π)−n
2∣detAξ∣∫Rnf(x)e−ix⋅ξφ(Aξ(x−b))dx,(b,ξ)∈Rn×Rn, (237)
with the inversion formula as f=F−1ASφf,where Fis the inverse FT and the operator Ais given by (AF)(ξ)=
∫RnF(b,ξ)db,ξ∈Rnfor all measurable function FonRn×Rnprovided the integral exists. It right hand side
of equation (237) can be can be written in the form ⟨f, φb,ξ,Aξ⟩L2(Rn)with φb,ξ,Aξ=(2π)−n
2MξτbDAξφ,where
(DAξφ)(x)=∣detAξ∣φ(Aξx),(τbφ)(x)=φ(x−b)and(Mξφ)(x)=eix⋅ξφ.Author in [167], gave a resolution of
identity formula for the n−dimensional ST associated with some special class of matrices, which are discussed below:
LetAξ∈GL(n,R),ξ∈Rn∖{0}satisfying the conditions
(i)η=(A−1
ξ)t
ζfor some ζ∈Rnthen there exists positive functions f1, f2onRnsuch that ∣det(∂η
∂ξ)∣=f1(η)
f2(ξ),ξ,η∈
Rn,where∂η
∂ξis the Jacobian matrix of ηwith respect to ξ
(ii) there exists a vector v∈Rnsuch that (A−1

ξ=v,
then, for such matrices the following resolution of identity holds
∫Rn∫Rn(Sφf)(b,ξ)(Sφg)(b,ξ)dbdξ
f2(ξ)=cφ⟨f, g⟩L2(Rn), (238)
for all f, g∈L2(Rn),where relation cφ=∫Rn∣ˆφ((A−1

f2(ξ)=∫Rn∣ˆφ(η−v)∣2dη
f1(η)<∞.Furthermore, if for
allξ=(ξ1, ξ2,⋯, ξn)∈Rn, ξl≠0, l=1,2,⋯, n,we consider the matrices Iξ=(δll′)n×n, δll=ξlandδll′=0,ifl≠l′,the
the corresponding transform is called the non-isotropic n−dimensional ST given as
(Sφf)(b,ξ)=(2π)−n
2Πn
l=1∣ξl∣∫Rne−ix⋅ξf(x)φ(Iξ(x−b))dx (239)
and the corresponding resolution of identity is given as equation (238) with f2(ξ)=Πn
l=1∣ξl∣andcφ=∫Rn∣ˆφ(ξ−1)∣2dξ
Πn
l=1∣ξl∣,
where 1=(1,1,⋯,1)∈Rn.These results, in [167], extend those for the two-dimensional ST studied by Liu et al.
in [128]. Hleili et al. [101] proved that the transform Sφfgiven in (239) have the property that for window functions
φandψ,(Sφf)(Sψg)∈Lp(Rn×Rn,dbdξ
∣detIξ∣)for all p∈[1,∞]andf, g∈L2(Rn).Riba et al. [167] also introduced a
special class of matrices Aξsatisfying
(I)1
∣ξ∣Aξ∈O(n,R)for every ξ∈Rn∖{0},
(II) there exists a matrix P∈O(n,R)such that Aξζ=PAζξ,
(III) there exists a vector v∈Rnsuch that (A−1

This class of matrices are such that Aξ∈GL(n,R),ξ∈R0and it satisfies both the property (i) and (ii). The

of order 2 ,4 and 8 respectively satisfy properties (I),(II) and (III). Authors in [166] explained that the family Aξ∈
GL(n,R),ξ∈R0for which the properties (i) and (ii) hold cannot be satisfied for the dimensions apart from 1 ,2,4 and
8.They also extended the multidimensional ST to the multidimensional modified ST. For that, they considered the
multidimensional dilation operator Ds
Aφ,1≤s<∞,defined for A∈GL(n,R)as
(Ds
Aφ)(x)=∣detA∣−1
sφ(A−1x),x∈Rn(240)
for all measurable function φonRn.In particular, D2
Ais a unitary operator on L2(Rn).Also let, A∶Rn→GL(n,R),
be given by ξ↦Aξ.Then the multi-dimensional modified ST of f∈L2(Rn)with respect to φ∈L2(Rn)was given by
Riba et al. [166] as

Moreover, the equation (245) is applicable in all the dimensions to the constant and diagonal matrix-valued functions

The two-dimensional ST given in [128] is inadequate for capturing anisotropic features like corners and edges of
signals due to the directional insensitivity of the window function. So, Shah et al. [176] proposed a novel transform
called the non-isotropic angular ST with respect to a window function ψ∈L2(R2)defined as
(Mψf)(b,ξ, θ)=1
2π⟨f, ψθ
b,ξ⟩L2(R2) (246)
for any f∈L2(R2),with
ψθ
b,ξ(t)=EξRθDAξτbψ(t)=∣detAξ∣eit⋅ξψ(R−θAξ(t−b)), (247)
where(DAξψ)(t)=∣detAξ∣ψ(Aξt),(Eξψ)(t)=eiξ⋅tψ(t), τbψ)(t)=ψ(t−b),(Rθψ)(t)=ψ(R−θt), Aξ=(ξ10
0ξ2), ξ1, ξ2≠
0 and Rθ=(cosθsinθ
−sinθcosθ),ξ,b∈R2, θ∈[0,2π).Apart from the several important properties like linearity, anti-
linearity, translation, scaling, reflection and conjugation, authors expressed the non-isotropic angular ST in the Fourier
domain as (Mψf)(b,ξ, θ)=e−iξ⋅bF−1[ˆf(ω)ˆψ((ω−ξ)A−1
ξRθ)](b)and obtained the following resolution of identity
formula
∫R2∫R2∖{0}∫2π
0(Mψf)(b,ξ, θ)(Mψg)(b,ξ, θ)dθdξdb=Cψ⟨f, g⟩L2(R2), f, g∈L2(R2) (248)
42
Cψ=∫R2∖{0}∫2π
0∣(Fψ)((ω−ξ)A−1
ξRθ)∣2
dθdξ<∞.This in particular, for f=g,implies that ∥Mψf∥2
L2(R2)=
Cψ∥f∥2
L2(R),which further shows that for the function ψ∈L2(R2)satisfying Cψ=1,Mψis an isometry from
L2(R2)intoL2(R2×R2∖{0}×[0,2π))and hence it is one-one. Moreover, Mψ(L2(R2))is a proper subspace of
L2(R2×R2∖{0}×[0,2π)).Thus, square integrability of Mψfis necessary condition but not sufficient. The range
Mψ(L2(R2)),of bounded linear operator Mψf∶L2(R2)→L2(R2×R2∖{0}×[0,2π))which is isometric when Cψ=1,
is a closed subspace. Being closed subspace of the Hilbert space L2(R2×R2∖{0}×[0,2π)),Mψ(L2(R2))is also a
Hilbert space. Furthermore, it is a RKHS, with the kernel given by Kψ(b,ξ, θ;c,η, θ′)=1
(2π)2⟨ψθ
b,ξ, ψθ′
c,η⟩L2(R2).The
proposed transform (246), has the following inversion formula
f(t)=1

0(Mψf)(b,ξ, θ)ψθ
b,ξ(t)dθdξdb, a.e. (249)
where ψθ
b,ξ(t)is given in (247).
Uncertainty Principles: Motivated by the idea of Singer [187] and Wilczok [209] in the case of WFT and WT,
authors in [176] obtained a class of UPs results for comparing the localization of fandFfwith the localization of
the non-isotropic angular ST regarded as function of one variable as Rb,ω≥Cψ
2∥f∥2
2andRξ,t≥Cψ
2∥f∥2
2,where
Rb,ω={∫R2∫R2∖{0}∫2π

As a consequence of which we have Rb,ωRξ,t≥Cψ
2∥f∥2
2,which shows that the phase-space localization of the pair
(f,Ff)varies inversely with the phase space localization of the transform (246), i.e., better the phase-space localization
of(f,Ff), the worse is the phase-space localization of (Mψf)(b,ξ, θ)and vice versa. In fact, a more general version
forf∈Lp(R2)is proved by the authors as
{∫R2∫R2∖{0}∫2π

13 Short time fractional Fourier transform (STFrFT)
The FrFT only reveals the overall fractional Fourier domain (FrFD) frequency content of the signal. Sometimes, we
want to know the FrFD-frequency contents and how they change over time. So, the representation combining the
time and FrFD-frequency information should be developed. A localized FrFT was developed in [136], [215], [144]
based on which time/space-dependent FrFD filtering approach was obtained. But they cannot be regarded as the
time-FrFD-frequency representation since it has no explicit 2 −Ddomain. A kind of STFrFT was proposed in [48]. It
modifies the classical STFrFT by utilizing a dechirp window whose chirp rate is obtained by the FrFT in a searching
scheme. An adaptive STFrFT was given in [222] for the function f∈L2(R)with respect to the FrFT domain window
function g(ω′)∈L2(R)as
(Gα
gf)(ω, t)=∫R(Fαf)(ω′)g(ω′−ω)e−iω′tdω′, (253)
43
which rotates the signal in the time-frequency domain by the FrFT before implementing the STFT. They could be
classified as a kind of adaptive STFT rather than time-FrFD-frequency representation because they analyze signals in
the time-frequency domain but not in the time-FrFD-frequency domain. Such a definition was independently derived
by Stankovi` c et al. [191] for time-frequency analysis of chirp signals. From equation (253), it follows that the STFrFT,
which is given in [191], [222] looses all time-varying information and hence cannot be viewed as a joint time-FrFD-
frequency analysis transform. As a kind of time-FrFD-frequency representation, the different STFrFT was in Zhang et
al. [223] and Tao et al. [196], which is defined for functions f∈L2(R)with respect to the window function g∈L2(R)
((0)Gα
gf)(ω, t)=1√
2π∫Rf(x)g(x−t)Kα(x, ω)dx. (254)
The transform (254) is linear, which indicates that it satisfies the superposition principle, which is favorable for the
analysis of multicomponent signals. It satisfies the time marginal constraints, i.e., integrating the STFrFT with respect
to the time variable gives the LCT multiplied by a constant, i.e., ∫R((0)Gα
gf)(ω, t)dt=C(Fαf)(ω),for some constant
Cand the additivity of rotation, i.e., Fβ(((0)Gα
gf)(ω, t))(ω′, t)=((0)Gα+β
gf)(ω′, t).Apart from this, author in [196]
proved the covariance properties
((0)Gα
g[eiω0xf(x−t0)])(ω, t)=eiϕ(ω)((0)Gα
gf)(ω−(t0cosα+ω0sinα), t−t0),
ϕ(ω)=(ω0cosα−t0sinα)ω+t2
0−ω2
0
2sinαcosα+t0ω0sin2α.With the assumption that the window function satisfies
the conditions g(0)≠0,the 1−Dinversion formula is
f(t)=1
g(0)∫R((0)Gα
gf)(ω, t)Kα(t, ω)dω (255)
and under the assumption that ∥g∥L2(R)=1,the 2−Dinversion formula is f(x)=∫R∫R((0)Gα
gf)(ω, t)g(x−
t)Kα(x, ω)dtdω are also obtained in [196]. Based on the fractional convolution ⋆α,Shi et al. [185] obtained a novel
STFrFT which is defined for function f∈L2(R)with respect to the window function g∈L2(R)as
((1)Gα
gf)(ω, t)=e−itωcscα[f(x)⋆α(g(−x)eixωcscα)](ω)
=∫Rf(x)gα,t,ω(x)dx, (256)
where gα,t,ω(x)=g(x−t)e−ix2−t2
2cotα+ixωcscα.This definition can be equivalently written in fractional Fourier domain
as
((1)Gα
gf)(ω, t)=e−itωcscα∫R(Fαf)(ω′)(Fg)((ω′−ω)cscα)Kα(ω′, t)dω′, (257)
where(Fg)(ω′cscα)denotes the FT of gwith its argument scaled by csc α.Transform (256) is linear in fand
anti-linear in g.It satisfy the property called the additivity of rotation i.e., Fβ{Aαet2+ω2
2cotα((1)Gα
gf)(ω, t)}(ω′, t)=
((1)Gα+β
gf)(ω′, t), Aα=√
1−icotα
2π.Apart from this, it has the following covariance properties
((1)Gα
g(τx0f))(ω, t)=((1)Gα
gf)(ω, t−t0)ei(3
2x2
0−x0x)cotα−it0ωcscα
and
((1)Gα
g(eiω0xf(x)))(ω, t)=((1)Gα
gf)(ω−ω0sinα, t).
The covariance property obtained above indeed gives the formula for the WQPFT for the time and frequency shift of
a function f.Forf1, f2, g∈L2(R),the WQPFT (256) satisfies the following inner product relation
cscα∫R∫R((1)Gα
gf1)(ω, t)((1)Gαgf2)(ω, t)dtdω=⟨f1, f2⟩. (258)
In particular, if f1=f2=fthen(cscα)∥(1)Gα
gf∥2
L2(R2)=∥f∥2
L2(R)and thus WQPFT is an isometry from L2(R)
toL2(R2)upto some constant, this is called the energy conservation property. With the assumption that the time
44
domain window function gsatisfying the condition g(0)≠0,author obtained the 1 −Dinversion formula for the
transform (256) as f(t)=cscα
2πg(0)∫R((1)Gα
gf)(ω, t)eitωcscαdωand also for the time domain window function γ(x),
h(x)∶=cscα
2π∫R∫R((1)Gα
gf)(ω, t)γα,t,ω(x)dtdω is such that if ∫Rγ(x)g(x)dx=1 then h(x)=f(x).There are several
choices of the window function γ(x)that satisfies ∫Rγ(x)g(x)dx=1.One such important choice is that γ(x)=g(x).

The transform (256) represents a 1 −Dsignal f(x)using the 2 −Dfunction ((1)Gα

conservation property, it follows that(1)Gα
gf∈L2(R2).It is not in general true that, a function FinL2(R2)is
a WQPFT of some function in L2(R).The author in [185] characterized the range(1)Gα

2π∫R∫RF(t, ω)⟨gα,t,ω, gα,t′,ω′⟩L2(R)dtdω.
Consequently, it follows that the range(1)Gα
g(L2(R))is a RKHS with the kernel1
2π⟨gα,t,ω, gα,t′,ω′⟩L2(R).In view of
equation (256) and its representation in the fractional Fourier domain (257), the WQPFT gives the local information
off(x)in the time window [Eg+t−∆g, Eg+t+∆g]and the local information of f(x)in the fractional Fourier
domain [EGsinα+ω−∆Gsinα, E Gsinα+ω+∆Gsinα], where Gis the FT of ghaving the constant window area

14 Fractional wavelet transform (FrWT)
The concept of FrWT was proposed by Mendlovic et al. [137], where fractional FT is firstly used to derive the fractional
spectrum of a signal, and the WT is then performed on the obtained fractional spectrum. Since the fractional spectrum
derived by the FrFT only represents the FrFD-frequency over the entire duration of the signal, the FRWT defined
in [137] actually fails in obtaining the information of the local property of the signal. To overcome this drawback,
using the relation (208), between the WT and the classical convolution, Shi et al. [184] defined a novel FrWT by
replacing the classical convolution by the fractional convolution (29) as
(Wα
ψf)(a, b)=(f⋆αδa˜ψ)(b)
=∫Rf(t)ψα,a,b(t)dt, (262)
where
ψα,a,b(t)=e−i
2(t2−b2)cotαψa,b(t) (263)
andψa,b(t)=1√aψ(t−b
a).Equation (262) can be expressed in terms of the FrFT of fas
(Wα
ψf)(a, b)=∫R√
2πa(Fαf)(ξ)ˆψ(aξcscα)K−α(ξ, b)dξ (264)
It is to be noted that for α=1,the FrWT (262) reduces to the classical WT. It is a matter of simple verification that
Wα
ψfis linear in fand conjugate linear in ψ.The following properties, called the covariance properties of the fraction
WT, give the formula for the FrWT of the dilation by c>0 of the function fwith respect to ψ
[(Wα
ψ(f(ct))](a, b)=1√c(Wβ
ψf)(ca, cb), a∈R+, b∈R (265)
where φ=cot−1(c2cotα)andβ=φ/(π
2).Bahri et al. [22] obtained the fractional convolution and the correlation
results associated with the FrWT as
(Wα
ψ1⋆αψ2(f⋆αg))(a, b)=1√a∫R(Wα
ψ1f)(a, b−u)(W−α
ψ2g)(a, u)du
and
(Wα
ψ1○αψ2(f○αg))(a, b)=1√a∫R(W−α
ψ1f)(a,−b+u)(W−α
ψ2g)(a, u)du,
respectively, where ○αis the fractional correlation given as (f○αg)(x)=∫Re−i
2(x2+y2)cotαf(y)g(x+y)dy.Authors
in [184] obtained the resolution of identity formula for the transform (262) as
∫R∫R+(Wα
ψf)(a, b)(Wα
ψg)(a, b)dadb
a2=2πcψ⟨f, g⟩L2(R), f, g∈L2(R) (266)
where cψis a positive constant depending on wavelet given as cψ=∫R∣ˆψ(ξ)∣2
ξdξ<∞,where ˆψ(ξ)denotes the FT of
ψ(t).This in particular, for f=g,implies that ∥Wα
ψf∥2
L2(R+×R,dadb
a2)=2πcψ∥f∥2
L2(R),which further shows that the
normalized WT1√
2πcψWα
ψis an isometry from L2(R)intoL2(R+×R, dµaff),where dµaff=dadb
a2denotes the so
called affine measure. Furthermore, the corresponding inversion formula is given by
f(t)=1
2πcψ∫R∫R+(Wα
ψf)(a, b)ψα,a,b(t)dadb
a2(267)
From equations (262) and (264), it follows that if the kernel ψα,a,b(t)is supported in the time domain, the (Wα
ψf)(a, b)
is supported in the time domain. Thus (Wα
ψf)(a, b)contains information about f(t)nearb.Similarly, if ˆψ(aξcscα)is
bandpass, i.e., ˆψ(ξ)satisfies the condition cψ<∞,then the multiplication ˆf(ξ)andˆψ(aξcscα)can provide fractional-
domain local properties of f(t). This implies that the FrWT is capable of providing the time- and fractional-domain
information simultaneously, hence giving a time-fractional-frequency representation of the signal. To be specific, both
ψ(t)and its FT ˆψ(ξ)must have sufficiently fast decay so that they can be used as window functions. Suppose that ψ(t)
andˆψ(ξ)are functions with finite centers EψandEˆψand finite radii ∆ ψand ∆ ˆψ. Then, the center and radii of the
46
time-domain window function ψα,a,b(t)of the FrWT are respectively given by E[ψα,a,b(t)]=b+aEψand ∆[ψα,a,b(t)]=
a∆ψ,where E[⋅]and ∆[⋅]denote the expectation and deviation operator respectively. Similarly, the center and radii
of the frequency-domain window function ˆψ(aξcscα)of the WT can be easily derived as E[ˆψ(aξcscα)]=Eˆψ
aand
∆[ˆψ(aξcscα)]=∆ˆψ
a.TheQ−factor (or the ratio between the width and the center) of the fractional-domain window
function of the FrWT is given by Q=∆ˆψ
Eˆψ,which is independent of the order αand the scaling parameter a.This
is the constant −Qproperty of the FrWT. Thus, the FrWT gives the local information of the signal f(t)in the time
window [b+aEψ−a∆ψ, b+aEψ+a∆ψ]and the local FrFD spectrum information in the fractional frequency window
[Eˆψ
a−∆ˆψ

with constant area 4∆ ψ∆ˆψsinαin the time-FrFD-frequency plane. The area depends only on the mother wavelet
ψ(t)and the parameter αbut is independent of the parameters aandb.However, for a given α,the time-fractional-
frequency window varies with the scaling parameter a.More precisely, the window becomes narrower for detecting
high FrFD-frequency phenomena, i.e., small values of a, and wider for detecting low FrFD-frequency phenomena, i.e.,
large a.
In view of (264), it follows the FrWT (262) analyzes the signal in time-frequency-FrFD domain, its physical
meaning requires deeper interpretation. So, Prasad et al. [160] expressed the FrWT (262) in the fractional Fourier
domain as
(Wα
ψf)(a, b)=√a∫Re−i
2(b2+ξ2)cotα+ibξcscα+i
2a2ξ2cotα(Fαf)(ξ)Fα[e−i
2(⋅)2cotαψ](aξ)K−α(ξ, b)dξ (269)
as a result, the signal analysis only involves the time-FrFD domain. Moreover, in that case, the wavelet satisfies the
following admissibility condition
cψ,α=∫R+∣Fα(e−i
2(⋅)cotαψ)(ξ)∣2
∣ξ∣dξ<∞. (270)
Authors in [160], generalized the inner product relation (266) in terms of two wavelets ψ1, ψ2∈L2(R)as
∫R∫R+(Wα
ψ1f)(a, b)(Wα
ψ2g)(a, b)dadb

2(⋅)2cotαψ1](a)Fα[e−i
2(⋅)2cotαψ2](a)da
a<∞.From (271) it
follows that, if ψ1=ψ2=ψthen we have ∫R∫R+(Wα

a2=2πsinαcψ,α⟨f, g⟩L2(R).Furthermore,

Motivated by the convolution operator (23) given by Zayed, Dai et al. [56] introduced a new definition of the fractional

As a result of which, the authors in [56] obtained the following inner product relation
∫R+∫R(Wα

where cψ=∫R+∣Fαψ(s)∣2

tity∫R∣f(t)∣2dt=1
2πsinαCψ∫R+∫R∣(Wα

a2db.As a consequence of which it can be shown that the range

2πsinαCψ∫Rψa,b,α(t)ψa0,b0,α(t)dt.
The FrWT (272) gives the local information of the signal f(t)in the time window [b+aEψ−a∆ψ, b+aEψ+a∆ψ]
and the local FrFD spectral information in the FrFD as [kEFβψ−k∆Fβψ, kEFβψ+k∆Fβψ],where k=√
1−icotα
a2−icotα, β=
arctan(a2tanα),with the constant window area 4 ak∆ψ∆Fβψin the time-FrFD-frequency plane. The area depends
only on the mother wavelet ψand the angle αand is independent of the parameters aandb.Guo et al. [86] defined
a general FrWT, using some particular type of convolutions given in (32), as
(Wα,β
ψf)(a, b)=f(t)⋆α,α,β1√aψ(−t
a)
=e−i
2b2cotα[f(t)ei
2t2cotα⋆1√aψ(−t
a)ei
2t2cotβ](b). (276)
This definition of the FrWT has the equivalent form
(Wα,β
ψf)(a, b)=∫Rf(t)ψa,b,α,β(t)dt, (277)
where
ψa,b,α,β(t)=1√aψ(t−b
a)e−i
2[(t2−b2)cotα−(t−b
a)2cotβ]. (278)
The window function ψα,β,a,b(t)of proposed FrWT has one more free parameter β,and thus the proposed transform
has more degree of freedom of parameter selection. The transform have the scaling property (Wα,β
ψf(ct))(a, b)=
1√c(Wα′,β
ψf)(ca, cb),where c>0 and α′satisfies cot α′=cotα
c2.Moreover, it reduces to the classical WT when α=β=π
2
and to the FrWT (262) and (272) when β=π
2andα=βrespectively. Also, it can be expressed in the fractional
Fourier domain with λ=cscβ

(Wα,β
ψf)(a, b)=√a
Aβ∫Rei
2(aξ
λ)2cotβ(Fαf)(ξ)(Fβψ)(aξ
λ)K−α(ξ, b)dξ. (279)
In term of fractional domain, the window and signal are restricted to same fractional domain (i.e., FαψandFαf)
for the transform (272) defined by [56], whereas for the transform (276), it appears from (279), that the window and
signal can be transformed freely to different fractional domains (i.e., FβψandFαf). The following resolution of the
identity formula holds for the transform (272)
∫R∫R(Wα,β

From (280), it follows that ∫R∫R∣(Wα,β
ψf)(a, b)∣2dadb
a2=2πsinβcψ,β∫R∣f(t)∣2dt,as a result of which it follows that
the range Wα,β
ψ(L2(R))of the FrWT given by (276) is a RKHS with the kernel given by Kψ,α,β(a0, b0, a, b)=
1
2πsinβcψ,β∫Rψa,b,α,β(t)ψa0,b0,α,β(t)dt.In view of equations (277) and (279), the FrWT (276) gives the local infor-
mation of the signal f(t)in the time window [b+aEψ−a∆ψ, b+aEψ+a∆ψ]and the local FrFD spectral information
48
in the FrFD as [λ

FrFD-frequency plane, where λ=cscβ
cscα.The area depends only on the mother wavelet ψand the parameter α, βand
is independent of the parameters aandb.Motivated by the work of Pandey et al. ( [145], [150]), Verma et al. [200]

which is defined for the f∈L2(Rn)and the function ψ∈L2(Rn)satisfying the admissibility condition cα,λ=

(µ∗ν)(x)=∫Rnµ(y)ν(x−y)dy,
which can equivalently be written as (Wα,λ

Ψα,λ,a,b(t)=c(αλ)eα,λ2(b)eα,−λ2(t)1√

They proved basic properties like linearity, anti-linearity, dilation, parity, conjugation, and translation of the FrWT

Definition (285) not only combine the advantages of the multidimensional FrFT but also inherit the characteristics
of the classical WT in n−dimension studied in [145]. It reduces to (272) with a constant multiple√

Bahri et al. [22] studied the FrWT (262) on the generalized Sobolev spaces Hs

14.1 Multiresolution Analysis (MRA)
Multiresolution analysis (MRA) has become an important tool for the construction of a discrete wavelet system, i.e.,
an orthonormal basis for L2(R).It was first formulated by Mallet [133]. Some of the important wavelets that have
been obtained from the MRA are Haar wavelet, Shannon wavelet, Meyer wavelet, Daubechies wavelet, etc. [57], [58].
Not all wavelets are derived via MRA; there are some wavelets, like the Mexican hat wavelet and Morlet wavelet, that
do not come from an MRA (see [152]).
Definition 14.3. The MRA consists of a sequence of closed subspaces {Vm}m∈ZinL2(R)satisfying the properties
1.Vm⊂Vm+1,∀m∈Z
2.f(t)∈Vmif and only if f(2t)∈Vm+1,∀m∈Z
3.∩m∈ZVm={0},∪m∈ZVm=L2(R)
4. there exists a function ϕ∈V0such that {ϕ0,n(t)∶n∈Z}form an orthonormal basis of V0,where
ϕm,n(t)=2m
2ϕ(2mt−n), m, n∈Z.
Shi et al. [182] developed the MRA associated with the FrWT (262) by discretizing the parameters aandbby
dyadic grids, i.e., a=am
0andb=nam
0b0, m, n∈Zto the family (263), results in the following, which contains one
extra parameter α.As a result of which, a new class of orthonormal basis of L2(R)can be obtained
(I)Vα
m⊂Vα
m+1,∀m∈Z
(II)f(t)∈Vα
mif and only if f(2t)ei
2((2t)2−t2)cotα∈Vα
m+1,∀m∈Z
(III)∩m∈ZVα
m={0},∪m∈ZVαm=L2(R)
(IV) there exists a function ϕ∈Vα
0such that {ϕα,0,n(t)∶n∈Z}form an orthonormal basis of Vα
0,where
ϕα,0,n(t)=2m
2ϕ(2mt−n)e−it2−n2
2cotα, n∈Z.
Indeed condition (IV) can be relaxed by assuming that the set of functions {ϕα,0,n(t)∶n∈Z}is a Riesz basis of
Vα
0={∑n∈Zc[n]ϕ0,n,α(t)∶c[n]∈l2(Z)}.The fractional MRA so defined consists of one extra parameter αcompared
to the classical and reduces to the later for α=π

2ξcscα(Fψ)(ξcscα
2).
51
Also for the scaling function ϕ(t)=χ[0,1)(t),the corresponding ψis given by ψ(t)=χ[0,1
2)(t)−χ[1
2,1)(t).Guo et
al. [86] developed the fractional MRA associated with the family (278) by discretizing the dilation parameter aand
the translation parameter b,with a=am
0andb=nam
0b0,where m, n∈Z, a0>0, b0≠0.Of particular interest, is the
dyadic grid, which occur for a0=2, b0=1.Authors considered a sequence of closed sub-spaces {Vα,β
m}m∈ZofL2(R)
satisfies the following properties.
(i)Vα,β
m⊂Vα,β
m+1,∀m∈Z
(ii)f(t)∈Vα,β
mif and only if f(2t)ei
2((2t)2−t2)cotα∈Vα,β
m+1,∀m∈Z
(iii)∩m∈ZVα,β
m={0},∪m∈ZVα,β
m=L2(R)
(iv) there exists a function ϕ∈Vα,β
0such that {ϕα,β,0,n(t)∶n∈Z}form an orthonormal basis of Vα,β
0,where
ϕα,β,m,n(t)=2m
2ϕ(2mt−n)e−i
2[(t2−(n
2m)2)cotα−(2mt−n)2cotβ], m, n∈Z.
If the orthogonality in (iv) is relaxed by the assumption that {ϕα,β,0,n}n∈Zis a Riesz basis of Vα,β
0,theϕgenerates a
generalized MRA associated with the FrWT. Authors obtained a result showing a way to construct an orthonormal
basis from Riesz basis {ϕα,β,0,n}n∈ZofVα,β
0.The MRA so developed reduces to the MRA proposed by Dai et al. [56]
when α=βand to definition 14.1 if α=β=π
2.The subspace Wα,β
mis defined as the orthogonal complement of Vα,β

inVα,β
m+1,i.e.,
Wα,β
m⊥Vα,β
m, Vα,β
m+1=Vα,β
m⊕Vα,β
m,∀m∈Z.
Then according to the definition, {Wα,β
m}m∈Zhave the following properties
1.Wα,β
k⊥Vα,β
l,∀k≠l;
2.⊕m∈ZWα,β
m=L2(R)
3.g(t)∈Wα,β
mif and only if g(2t)ei
2((2t)2−t2)cotα∈Wα,β
m+1,∀m∈Z.
From the second property, it follows that an orthonormal basis of L2(R)can be constructed by finding out an
orthonormal basis of Wα,β
m.Third property says that the problem of finding this basis is centered to finding an
orthonormal basis of Wα,β
0.Thus the crucial point is to construct a function ψ∈L2(R)such that {ψα,β,0,n(t)}n∈Z
form an orthonormal basis of Wα,β
0,where ψα,β,0,n(t)=ψ(t−n)e−i
2((t2−n2)cotα−(t−n)2cotβ).The two free parameters α
andβinvolved in the MRA helps in the construction of several new classes of orthonormal basis of L2(R).The presence
of these two free parameters makes the MRA developed in [86] more flexible as compared to that in [182] and [56].
Thus, it results in developing a new class of orthonormal basis of L2(R).For example, for some scaling function ϕ
taken in the fractional Fourier domain the corresponding fractional wavelet is given in the fractional Fourier domain
as(Fβψ)(ξ
λ)=ei

λ)(Fβϕ)(ξ
2λ),where λ=cscβ
cscα.Authors in [3]
proved that the conditions in the definition of the fractional MRA given in [56], which is a particular case when α=β,
are not independent. More precisely, the intersection triviality condition ∩m∈ZVα,α={0}can be obtained from the
conditions (i), (ii) and (iv) for α=β.In addition to these assumptions if (Fαϕ)(ξ)is continuous at ξ=0,they proved
that the union density condition ∪m∈ZVα,α=L2(R)is equivalent to the condition (Fαϕ)(0)≠0.These results are in
fact the counter part of those given in [95].
15 Fractional Stockwell Transform (FrST)
In 2012, Xu et al. [212] first proposed a FrST based on the idea of of the FrFT and the ST with Gaussian window as
(Sαf)(τ, u)=∫∞
−∞f(t)g(τ−t, u)Rα(t, u)dt, (289)
where the Gaussian window g(τ−t, u)is a scalable function of tand the fractional Fourier frequency (FrFfr) u
g(t, u)=∣ucscα∣p
√
2πqe−t2(ucscα)2p
2q2andRα(t, u)=√
1−icotαeiπ(u2cotα−2utcscα+t2cotα), α∉πZ.It is to be noted that, when
α=π
2andp=q=1,then the FrST (289) is the classical ST (224) given in [193]. Observe that the window g(t, u)
52
width is directed by u,i.e., the window width is wider in the time domain at lower FrFfr u,whereas it is narrower at
higher u.Authors proved the linearity of the transform (289) followed by the scaling formula
(Sαf(ct))(τ, u)=√
c2(1−icotα)
c2−icotαeiπu2cotα(1−cos2β
cos2α)(Sβf)(cτ, usinβ
csinα),
where β=arctan(c2tanα)followed by the inversion formula
f(t)=∫∞
−∞[∫∞
−∞(Sβf)(τ, u)dτ]Rα(t, u)du.
For more properties and the applications of the fractional Stockwell transform (289), we refer the reader to a survey
paper [165]. Recently, Srivastava et al. [189] introduced the FrST of a function f∈L2(R)with respect to the window
function ψ∈L2(R)as
(Sα
ψf)(a, b)=1√
2π(M−ξf⋆αDξ˜ψ)(b), (290)
where ˜ψ(t)=ψ(−t),and the convolution ⋆αis the fractional convolution given by (29), after multiplying it by the
factor√
2π. Equation (290) can be written in the form
(Sα
ψf)(a, b)=1√
2π∫Rf(t)ψα
a,b(t)dt, (291)
where ψα
a,b(t)=∣a∣ψ(a(t−b))eiat−i(t2−b2)cotα
2 , a∈R∗, b∈R.It is a matter of simple verification that Sα
ψfis linear in f
and conjugate linear in ψ.The following properties called the covariance properties of the FrST give respectively the
formula for the FrST of the translation by x0and dilation by c∈R∗of function fwith respect to the ψ
[(Sα
ψ(τx0f)](a, b)=eix0((x0−b)cotα−a)(Sα
ψ(Mx0cotαf))(a, b−x0)
and
[(Sα
ψ(f(ct))](a, b)=(Sβ
ψf)(a
c, cb), β=arccot(cotα
c).
If the function ψis such that it satisfied the admissibility condition, i.e., cψ=∫R∗∣F[eizψ(z)](ξcscα
a)∣2
dais non-zero
finite, then Sα
ψsatisfies the resolution of identity formula
∫R∗×R(Sα
ψf)(a, b)(Sα
ψg)(a, b)dadb=cψ⟨f, g⟩L2(R), (292)
followed by the inversion formula
f(t)=1√
2πcψ∫R×R∗(Sα
ψf)(a, b)ψα
a,b(t)dadb.
Forf=g,(292), yields the energy preserving relation ∥(Sα
ψg)(a, b)∥2
L2(R∗×R)=cψ∥f∥2
L2(R).If further cψ=1,the FrST
(290) becomes an isometry from L2(R)toL2(R∗×R).Moreover, the range Sα
ψ(L2(R))is a RKHS with the kernel
Kα
ψ(a, b;a0, b0)=1
2πcψ⟨ψα
a,b, ψα
a0,b0⟩.In view of equation (291) and its representation in the FrFD, the FrST (290) gives
the local information of f(t)in the time window [b+Eψ
a−∆ψ
a, b+Eψ
a+∆ψ
a]and the local FrFD spectral information
in the FrFD as [asinαEΨ−asinα∆Ψ, asinαEΨ+asinα∆Ψ], where Ψ (ξ)=Fα[eizψ(z)](ξ)with the constant window
area 4 sin α∆ψ∆Ψin the time-fractional-frequency plane. The area depends only on ψand the parameter αand is
independent of the parameter aandb.Also, it is worth noting that the fractional parameter αcan be invoked to
optimize the concentration of the Stockwell spectrum in the time-fractional-frequency plane. Wei et al. [207] used the
definition of fractional convolution ⋆α(29), to give a new definition of FrST for the function f∈L2(R)with respect
to the window function ψas
(Sα
ψf)(a, b)=1√
2π[e−iatf(t)⋆αa˜ψ(at)](b)
=1√
2π∫Rf(t)ψα,a,b(t)dt, (293)
53
where ψα,a,b(t)=aψ(a(t−b))eiatcscα−i
2(t2−b2)cotα.They proved that the transform is linear in fand anti-linear in ψ
and obtained the formula for the FrST of the translation and dilation of fas
(Sα
ψf(t−k))(a, b)=e−iakcscα+i(k2−kb)cotα(Sα
ψ(f(t)eiktcotα))(a, b−k)
and
(Sα
ψf(λt))(a, b)=(Sβ

λ, λb), λ∈R+, β=arc cot(α

If the window function ψsatisfies the admissible conditions cψ=∫∣F(ψ(t)ejtcscα)(ucscα/a)∣da<∞thenSα

In view of (293) and its representation in the fractional Fourier domain, it follows that the FrST (293) is capable
of providing the time and spectral information simultaneous and representing signal in the time-fractional-frequency
domain. It gives local information of the signal f(t)with the time window [b+Eψ
a−∆ψ
a, b+Eψ
a+∆ψ
a]and the local
information about the fractional Fourier domain spectrum of f(t)as[aEG−a∆G, aEG+a∆G]sinα,with the constant
window area 4 sin α∆ψ∆Gin the time-fractional-frequency plane where G(u)=F(ψ(t)eitcscα)(u). This area depends
on the function ψand the rotation angle αand is independent of the parameters aandb.Moreover, the window
narrows for the small value and widens for larger values of a.
Kamalakkannan et al. [107] proposed a two-dimensional FrST, associated with the coupled FrFT (35), of a function
f∈L2(R2)with respect to a non-zero window function ψ∈L1(R2)∩L2(R2)as
(Sψ,α,βf)(z,v)=(EγDρ˘ψ⊗Mρf)(z), (294)
z∈R2,v∈(R∗)2={(x1, x2)t∈R2∶x1≠0, x2≠0}andρ=(ρ1, ρ2)t=ζv(see (35)), where ⊗denotes the convolution
associated with the coupled FrFT given in (37), Eγis same as that in (36) and (Dρf)(x)=∣det(Aρ)∣f(Aρx),
Aρ=[ρ10
0ρ2].With the assumption that the window function ψsatisfies the admissibility condition
0≠cψ=1
2π∫(R∗)2∣ˆψ(ξ−(1,1)t)∣2 dξ
∣det(Aξ)∣<∞
authors obtained the inner product relation of the FrST
cψ⟨f, g⟩=∫(R∗)2(Sψ,α,βf)(z,v)(Sψ,α,βg)(z,v)dzdv
∣det(Aρ)∣,ρ=ζv, (295)
followed by the inversion formula
f(x)=d
2π¯dcψ∫(R∗)2M−ρ((Sψ,α,βf)(⋅,v)⊗EγDρψ)(x)dv
∣det(Aρ)∣. (296)
As a consequence of equation (295), it follows that Sψα,βf∈L2(R2×L2(R2),dzdv
∣det(Aρ)∣).Authors in [107], charac-
terized the range of the transform and proved that Sψ,α,β(L2(R2))is a RKHS with the kernel Kα,β
ψ(z,v,z′,v′)=
1
2π∫R2ψα,β
z,v(x)ψα,β
z′,v′(x)dx,where ψα,β
z,v(x)=2π¯dE−1
γ(z)(EγMρτzDρψ)(x).Forf∈Lp(R2), p=1,2 and g∈L1(R2),
the formula for the FrST of convolution ⊗is obtained as
Sψ,α,β(f⊗g)(z,v)=((Sψ,α,βf)(⋅,v)⊗Mρg)(z). (297)
Uncertainty Principles: Srivastava et al. [189] obtained the Heisenberg’s uncertainty inequality associated with
the FrST (290) as
{∫R∣ξ∣2∣(Fαf)(ξ)∣2dξ}1

where αandβare chosen such that β=α−γand sin α,sinβ,sinγ≠0.The fractional parameters govern these relations
and are fruitful in understanding mutual relations among different transform domains. Using the Heisenberg UP for
the coupled FrFT, the author in [107] obtained the Heisenberg UP for the FrST (294), which is given by

16 Windowed Linear Canonical Transform (WLCT)
Compared to the FT and the FrFT, LCT is more flexible with more extra degrees of freedom but with a similar com-
putational cost as the conventional FT. Because of the mentioned advantages, the LCT has found many applications
in filter designing, signal synthesis, optics, radar analysis, pattern recognition, etc. For example, filtering in the linear
canonical domain, given in [34], can achieve better performance than in the fractional Fourier domain owing to more
degree of freedom. Especially when multi-component chirp signals interfere with the desired signal, only one filter is
used in the LCT domain usually, but several filters are required in the FRFT domain [68]. Despite these benefits, it
has limitations on its own. The LCT cannot reveal the local LCT-frequency component because of its global kernel.
As a result, Kou et al. [115] introduced the WLCT by substituting the FT kernel with the LCT kernel in the WFT
definition, which is defined for the function fwith respect to gas
(VM
gf)(x, u)=∫Rf(t)τxg(t)KM(t, u)dt, (299)
where M=(A, B;C, D)with det (M)=1,andB>0.Observe that, if f∈L2(R), g∈L2(R)and the window function
f∈L1(R), g∈L∞(R)then the WLCT (299) is well defined. Similarly, if f∈Lq(R)andf∈Lp(R),1≤p, q<∞and
1
p+1
q=1,then by H¨ older’s inequality it follows that the WLCT (299) is well defined. Bahri et al. [21] proved that the
WLCT satisfied the inequality ∥(VM
gf)(⋅, u)∥Lp(R)≤1√
2πB∥g∥Lp(R)∥f∥L1(R)forg∈Lp(R)andf∈L1(R).They also
established the relation between the WLCT and the WFT and obtained the Lieb’s inequality for the WLCT

using the same (198) for the WFT [76]. The proof is simple as compared to the one given in [116]. Transform (299)
is linear in f,anti-linear in g.It satisfies the time marginal constraints, i.e., integrating the WLCT with respect
to the time variable gives the LCT multiplied by a constant, i.e., ∫R(VM
gf)(x, u)dx=(∫Rg(t)dt)LM(f)(u)and the
additivity of rotation, i.e., LM2((VM1gf)(x, u))(x, u′)=(VM2M1g f)(x, u′),where Ml=(Al, Bl;Cl, Dl), l=1,2 and
det(Ml)=1, Bl>0 [115]. Apart from this, it has the following covariance properties

cally, the formula for the parity, conjugation, (VM
g(τx0f))(x, u)and(VM
g(eiu0xf))(x, u)can be found in [21]. For
f1, f2, g1, g2∈L2(R),the WLCT (299) satisfies the following inner product relation [115], [21]
⟨(VM
g1f1)(x, u),(VM
g2f2)(x, u)⟩
L2(R2)=⟨f1, f2⟩⟨g1, g2⟩. (300)
In particular, if f1=f2=fand∥g1∥L2(R)=∥g2∥L2(R)=1 then∥VM
gf∥L2(R2)=∥f∥L2(R)and thus WLCT is an isometry
from L2(R)toL2(R2). The inversion formula for the WLCT is given as
f(t)=1
⟨g1, g2⟩∫R∫R(VM
g2f)(x, u)KM(t, u)τxg1(t)dudx (301)
where g1, g2∈L2(R),⟨g1, g2⟩≠0 and f∈L2(R).In fact, a stronger version of the inversion formula (301) is proved
by the authors in [115]. Its formulation resembles an L2−function by an approximation procedure. For that a
nested sequence of compact sets Kn⊂R2satisfying ∪n∈NKn=R2andKn⊂intKn+1is considered and that for
each n∈N, fn(t)=1

the WLCT (299) and the WFT, using which he gave an alternative proof of the properties like orthogonality property
and inversion formula. Han et al. [91] studied the inversion formula for recovering a signal from its WLCT different
from the inversion formula (301) by invoking the double integral and showing that every signal can be recovered from
its WLCT, with a univariate integral, with a suitable choice of window function gas
f(x)=1
g(0)∫R(VM
gf)(x, u)KM(x, u)du, (302)
which generalizes a similar result for the WFT [194]. More precisely, they proved that for f∈Lp(R),the integral
in (302) is convergent in Lp(R)for all 1<p<∞by showing that lim u1,u2→∞∥Ru1,u2f−g(x0)f∥Lp(R)=0 and they
also proved lim u→∞(Ru,uf)(x)=g(x0)f(x), a.e. , by applying the Carleson-Hunt theorem, showing that the integral
(302) converges a.e. on R,where where Ru1,u2f(x)=∫u2
−u1(VM
gf)(x−x0, u)KM(x, u)du, u 1, u2>0, x0is a fixed real
number and gis a continuous function such that g,ˆg∈L1(R).With the same assumption on g,authors in [91] obtained
the recovery formula of function in L1(R)from its WLCT by using the Ces` aro summability method by showing that
limh→∞∥σhf−g(x0)f∥Lp(R)=0,1≤p<∞and lim h→∞(σhf)(x)=g(x0)f(x), a.e., where σhf(x)=1

Using the convolution (75) given by Shi et al. [181], Zhang et al. [226] introduced a novel WLCT, which is defined for
f∈L2(R)and the parameter Ml=(Al, Bl;Cl, Dl), l=1,2,3 as
(VM1,M2,M3
g f)(t, u)=∫Rf(τ)gM1,M2,M3(t, u, τ)dτ, (303)
where gM1,M2,M3(t, u, τ)=g(τ−t)eiuτ
B1−iA1
2B1τ2−iA2
2B2(t−τ)2+iA3
2B3t2
.Equation (303) can be written in the generalized
canonical convolution (75) form as
(VM1,M2,M3
g f)(t, u)=[(f(v)e−iu
B1v)⋆M1,M2,M3g(−v)](t).
With a particular choice of the matrices i.e., M1=M3andM2=(0,1,−1,0),the transform reduces to the WLCT
mentioned in [185], [201] and for the choices M1=M3=(cosα,sinα,−sinα,cosα), M2=(0,1,−1,0),the transform
(303) reduces to the novel WFrFT (256) which analyze the signal in one linear canonical and one Fourier domain,
whereas it can be seen using the convolution theorem (76) that the transform analyzes the signal in two distinct linear
canonical domains. Authors in [185] only defined the WLCT, for which the mathematical properties were recently
explored by Wei et al. [201]. The linear transformation (303) have the covariance property

offis given as (VM1,M2,M3g (Mu0f))(t, u)=(VM1,M2,M3g f)(t, u−B1u0).Authors in [226] obtained the inner product

followed by the inversion formula given by f(x)=1
2π∣B1∣∫R∫R(VM1,M2,M3g f)(t, u)gM1,M2,M3(t, u, x)dtdu. With the
assumption that f1=f2=fand∥g∥L2(R)=1
2π,it follows from (304), that the novel WLCT (303) is an isom-
etry. Moreover, the range VM1,M2,M3g (L2(R))is a reproducing kernel with the kernel given by K(t, u;t0, u0)=
∫RgM1,M2,M3(t, u, τ)gM1,M2,M3(t0, u0, τ)dτ.In view of equation (303) and its representation in the linear canonical do-
main obtained using (76), the WLCT gives the local information of f(τ)in the time window [Eg+t−∆g, Eg+t+∆g]
and the local information of f(τ)in the linear canonical domain as

Bahri in [18] proved that if VM

the local UP for the FT, as

Using the logarithmic Sobolev-type UP for the FT give by Kubo et al. [119], author in [18] also obtained the logarithmic

Using the property that ln function is an increasing function, equation (305) can be obtained from (307). Using the
method adopted by Wilczok [209], Hleili [100] proved that VM
gfcannot have a support of finite measure. The author
also proved that the portion of VM
gflying outside some set S⊂R2cannot be arbitrarily small. For sufficiently small
S,this fact is justified by the following theorem
Theorem 16.1. (Concentration of VM

Apart from this, the author also studied the UP for the orthonormal sequence. They proved that if the WLCT of
each member of an orthonormal sequence is ϵ−concentrated in a set of finite measure then the sequence is necessarily
finite. More precisely, if s>0,0<ϵ<1

17 Linear canonical wavelet transform (LCWT)
Compared to the FrFT with one extra degree of freedom, LCT is more flexible for its extra degree of three degrees
of freedom and has been used frequently in time-frequency analysis and non-stationary signal processing. Inspired
by the FrWT, Wei et al. [202] introduced a new transform by combining the idea of LCT and the WT, called the
LCWT. This definition is obtained by replacing the classical convolution in (208) by the linear canonical convolution
(73) and is defined for a function f∈L2(R)and the function ψ∈L2(R)satisfying the admissibility condition
cψ∶=∫R∣ˆψ(ξ)∣2
ξdξ=∫R∣ˆψ(−ξ)∣2
ξdξ<∞,where ˆψ(ξ)=1√
2π∫Rf(t)e−itξdt,as
(WM
ψf)(a, b)=(f⋆′
Mδa˜ψ)(b)
=∫Rf(t)ψM
a,b(t)dt, (309)
where ψM
a,b(t)=e−iA(t2−b2)
2Bψa,b(t), a∈R+, b∈R.In particular, for M=(cosα,sinα,−sinα,cosα),it reduces to
the FrWT (262). The LCWT (309) can be expressed as (WM
ψf)(a, b)=e−iAb2
2B(Wψ[f(t)e−Ab2
2B])(a, b),in term
of the classical WT. The transform is linear and satisfy the following convolution formula (WM
ψ(f⋆Mg))(a, b)=
(WM
ψf)(a, b)(Wψg)(a, b),forf∈L2(R)andg∈L1(R)∩L2(R).Based on the convolution theorem (74) and the
inverse of LCT, the transform (309) can be expressed as
(WM
ψf)(a, b)=√
2πa∫R(LMf)(ξ)ˆψ(aξ
B)KM−1(ξ, b)dξ. (310)
As a consequence of which the authors in [202], [85] obtained the inner product theorem
∫R+∫R(WM
ψf)(a, b)(WM
ψg)(a, b)dadb
a2=2π∣B∣cψ⟨f, g⟩, (311)
followed by the inversion formula
f(t)=1
2π∣B∣cψ∫R+∫R(WM

given in [85]. In view of (309) and (310), it follows that the linear canonical wavelet transform is capable of pro-
viding the time and spectral information simultaneous and representing signal in the time-fractional-frequency do-
main. It gives local information of the signal f(t)with the time window [b+aEψ−a∆ψ, b+aEψ+a∆ψ]and the
local information about the linear canonical spectrum of f(t)as[Eˆψ
a−∆ˆψ
a,Eˆψ
a+∆ˆψ
a]B,with the constant window
area 4 B∆ψ∆ˆψin the time-LCT-frequency plane. This area depends on the function ψandBand is indepen-
dent of the parameters aandb.Thus, the LCWT (309) is capable of providing time and linear canonical domain
information simultaneously and representing the signal in the time-LCT-frequency plane with the transform param-
eterM.Prasad et al. [156] explored further the LCWT (309), with the alternative admissible condition of ψas
CM
ψ=∫R+∣(LM[e−ıa
2b(⋅)ψ])(ξ)∣2
∣ξ∣dξ<∞.They studied the properties like dilation property, parity and also obtained the
formula (WM
ψf)(λa, λb)=λn+1
2(WM′
ψf)(a, b), M′=(λ2A, B, C, D )when ψis a homogeneous function of degree n.
They also generalized the inner product relation (311) in the context of two linear canonical wavelet as

ψ2g)(a, b)dadb
a2=2π∣B∣cM

where cM

2B(⋅)ψ2])(a)da
a<∞.With the assumption that cM
ψ1,ψ2=1,Ansari et
al. [10] obtained the Calde` ron’s reproducing formula given as
f(t)=1
2π∣B∣∫R+((f(⋅)⋆M(ψ1)a(⋅))⋆M(ψ2)(−(⋅)))(t)da
a2,
where ψa(t)=1√aψ(−t
a).Authors also established the Abelian theorem, which relates the behavior of LCWT
(WM
ψf)(a, b)asa→∞(a→0)to the behavior of function (LMf)(ξ)asξ→∞(ξ→0).These results are also
58
referred to as initial value and final value Abelian theorems. Guo et al. [85] considered the test function space SM(R)
defined as

(0,1,−1,0)the space SM
ηreduces to the Schwartz space and the Gevrey space of test functions, respectively. Author
also considered generalized Sobolev space Bη,M

Bη,M
p,k(R)reduces to the H¨ ormander space Bp,k(R),when η(ξ)=log(1+∣ξ∣)andM=(0,1,−1,0).They determine the

ais a non-zero complex constant independent of ξsatisfying ∣ξ∣=1.In view of (314)

and the linear canonical domain window [aELMψ−a∆LMψ, aELMψ+a∆LMψ],respectively, with the joint resolution

aEψ+b+1
a∆ψ]×[aELMψ−a∆LMψ, aELMψ+a∆LMψ],
with constant area 4∆ ψ∆LMψin the time-LCT-frequency plane. Thus, for a given parameter M,the window area
depends on the linear canonical admissible wavelets and is independent of the parameters aandb.But it is noted
that the window gets narrower for a large value of aand wider for a small value of a.Thus, the window given by the
transform is flexible, and hence, it can simultaneously provide the time-linear canonical domain information.
Uncertainty Principles: Bahri et al. [31] studied the UPs associated with the LCWT (309). Adopting the method
in [209], they obtained the generalized Heisenberg and logarithmic UP for the transform using the same for the LCT

adopted by Wilczok [209], they proved that WM

that the portion of WM

this fact is justified by the following theorem
Theorem 17.1. (Concentration of WM

Apart from this, the author also studied the UP for the orthonormal sequence. They proved that if the LCWT (314) of

18 Linear Canonical Stockwell Transform (LCST)
Bahri et al. [32] replaced the Fourier kernel in (228) by the kernel KMof the LCT to define the LCST for the function
f∈L2(R)with respect to the window function ψ∈L2(R)as
(SM
ψf)(a, b)=∣a∣∫RKM(x, a)f(x)ψ(a(x−b))dx, x∈R, a∈R0. (316)
and obtained the formula for the translation and modulation of the function, including the inner product relation and
the reconstruction formula. Later, Bahri et al. [17] established the Heisenberg uncertainty and logarithmic UPs for
the transform (316). Replacing the classical convolution in (231) by the linear canonical convolution (71), Shah et
al. [175] defined the LCST of a function f∈L2(R)with respect to the window function ψ∈L2(R)as
(SM
ψf)(a, b)=1√
2π(M−af⋆MDξ˜ψ)(b), (317)
where ˜ψ(t)=ψ(−t)and⋆Mis the convolution given by (71). It is a matter of simple verification that Sψfis linear

19 Quadratic Phase Windowed Fourier Transform (QPWFT)
The importance of arbitrary real parameters involved in the definition of QPFT (87) lies in the fact that an appropriate
choice of the parameters can be used to inculcate a sense of rotation and shift into both the time and frequency axes,
resulting in an efficient analysis of the chirp-like signals which are ubiquitous in nature. Thus, the chirp-like signals
arising in radar and other communication systems reveal their characteristics better in the quadratic-phase Fourier
domain than in the usual Fourier domain, fractional Fourier, and linear canonical domain. Despite several merits of
the QPFT, one of its severe limitations is that it is inept for a localized analysis of the quadratic-phase spectrum
of non-transient signals. To circumvent this limitation, Shah et al. [173] introduced the notion of short-time QPFT,
63
which can effectively localize the quadratic phase spectrum of a non-transient signal in the time-frequency plane for
the function f∈L2(R)with respect to the window function ϕas
(V∧

nπ, n∈Zand∧=(0,1,0,0,0)and multiplying the right of the equation (322) by1√
iB,√
1−icotαand 1 respectively,
it can be seen that the WQPFT (322) reduces to the WLCT, WFrFT and WFT. Observe that, if f∈L2(R), g∈L2(R)
orf∈L1(R), g∈L∞(R)then the WQPFT (322) is well defined. Similarly, if f∈Lq(R)andg∈Lp(R),1≤p, q<∞
and1
p+1
q=1,then by H¨ older’s inequality it follows that the transform (322) is well defined. Based on the relation
between the WQPFT and the WFT, they obtained the Lieb’s inequality for the WQPFT
∫R∫R∣(V∧
ϕf)(x, u)∣p
dxdu≤2

Transform (322) is linear in f,anti-linear in gand has the following covariance properties
(V∧

ϕf(x−x0, B(u−µ))

0+Bx0(µ+u)+C(u2−µ2)+Dx0+E(u−µ2)+2Ax0−AB)Vϕf(x−x0,2Ax0−B(u−µ)),
where M∧
µf(t)=ei(At2+Btµ+Cu2+Dt+Eµ)f(t)is generalized modulation by µ.The covariance property obtained above
indeed gives the formula for the WQPFT for the time-frequency shift τx0M∧
µorM∧
µτx0of the function f.Specifi-
cally, the formula for the parity, conjugation, (V∧
ϕ(τx0f))(x, u)and(V∧
ϕ(eiu0xf))(x, u)can be found in [173]. For
f1, f2, ϕ1, ϕ2∈L2(R),the WQPFT (322) satisfies the following inner product relation
⟨(V∧
ϕ1f1)(x, u),(V∧
ϕ2f2)(x, u)⟩
L2(R2)=1
∣B∣⟨f1, f2⟩⟨ϕ1, ϕ2⟩. (323)
In particular, if f=g, ϕ 1=ϕ2=ϕand∥ϕ1∥L2(R)=∥ϕ2∥L2(R)=1 then∥V∧
ϕf∥2
L2(R2)=1
∣B∣∥f∥2
L2(R)and thus WQPFT is
an isometry from L2(R)toL2(R2). The inversion formula for the WQPFT is given as
f(t)=∣B∣√
2π⟨ϕ1, ϕ2⟩∫R∫R(V∧

where ϕ1, ϕ2∈L2(R),⟨ϕ1, ϕ2⟩≠0 and f∈L2(R).Authors in [173] also characterized the range of the transform (322)
and obtained the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle for the transform, for the functions f∈L2(R),using corresponding
UP (118) for the QPFT as

respectively.

20 Quadratic Phase Wavelet Transform (QPWT)
The QPFT is a generalization of classical WT, continuous FrWT, and the LCWT. The transform is a more beneficial
tool than the QPFT and the QPWFT. Prasad et al. [161] first introduced the definition, which was based on the
quadratic phase convolution (93) and is defined for the function f∈L2(R)with respect to the function ψ∈L2(R)and
the parameter ∧=(A, B, C, D, E )as
(W∧
ψf)(a, b)=(f⋆ΩA
Dψa)(b)

a,b(x)=1√aψ(t−b
a)e−iA(t2−b2)−iD(t−b), b∈R, a∈R+.The transform (327) is linear in f,
anti-linear in ψ.With the definition of the translation operator τ′
Arf(t)=e−2Airtf(t−r),author in [161] obtained
the translational formula (W∧
ψτArf)(a, b)=e−2Aibr(W∧
ψf)(a, b−r)and the scaling formula (W∧

sampling theorem (113), Gupta et al. [87] studied the MRA associated with QPWT given by (327) and obtain a

the QPWT (W∧

are also referred to as initial value and final value Abelian theorems. Based on the convolution (94), of the QPFT
introduced in [177], Shah et al. [171] introduced a new definition of the QPWT for a function f∈L2(R),with respect
to the function ψ∈L2(R)and the parameter set ∧=(A, B, C, D, E ),which we denote by(1)W∧

Uncertainty Principles: Using the properties of the QPFT and its relation with the QPWT, authors in [49], [161]
obtained the Heisenberg’s UP for the transform (329) using equation (118) as

In addition to these, using the local and entropy-based UP for the QPFT [174], authors also obtained the corresponding
UP for the QPWT.
21 Quaternion Windowed Fourier transform (QWFT)
The QFT generalizes the real and complex FT to the quaternion case. However, the QFT is ineffective in studying
the local behavior of the quaternion signal. To overcome this, B¨ ulow and Sommer constructed one such extension
by studying a particular case of QWFT with quaternionic Gabor filters [47], [46]. Their generalization was obtained
using the inverse (two-sided) quaternion Fourier kernel. Bahri et al. [29] generalized the classical WFT to quaternion-
valued functions of two variables using the right-sided QFT. Before we present here the definition of the QWFT,
let us recall that a quaternion window function is a function ϕ∈L2
H(R2)such that ∣x∣1
2ϕ(x)∈L2
H(R2).Moreover,
ϕω,b(x)=1
(2π)2ejω2x2eiω1x1ϕ(x−b)will be called as a quaternionic window daughter function. Thus the QWFT of a
function f∈L2
H(R2)with respect to the quaternion window function ϕis defined as
(Gϕf)(ω,b)=(f, ϕω,b)
=1
(2π)2∫R2f(x)ϕ(x−b)e−iω1x1e−jω2x2dx. (331)
where the inner product (⋅,⋅)is defined in (8). The QWFT (331) is different from [28] in the definition of the
exponential kernel. It is worth mentioning that the order of the exponentials in (331) is fixed because of the non-
commutativity of the product of quaternions. An example of a quaternion window function is the two-dimensional
Haar function
ϕ(x)=⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩1,for 0≤x1<1
2and 0≤x2<1
2
−1,for1
2≤x1<1 and1
2≤x1<1
0,otherwise.
The transform (331) is linear in fi.e.,(Gϕ(λf+µg))(ω,b)=λ(Gϕf)(ω,b)+µ(Gϕf)(ω,b), λ, µ∈H,(GPϕPf)(ω,b)=
(Gϕf)(−ω,−b)and for specific choice of functions f=f0+if2, ϕ=ϕ0+iϕ1the transform have the formula
(Gϕτx0f)(ω,b)=e−iω1x0((Gϕf)(ω,b−x0))e−jω2x0,x0=(x0, x1).Apart from this, using the machinery of the right-
sided QFT [97], [30], authors in [29] obtained the reconstruction formula f(x)=(2π)2
Cϕ∫R2∫R2(Gϕf)(ω,b)ϕω,b(x)dbdω,
with the assumption that Cϕ=∥ϕ∥2
L2
H(R2)and 0<Cϕ<∞and proved the orthogonality relation
∫R2∫R2(Gϕf)(ω,b)(Gϕg)(ω,b)dωdb=Cϕ
(2π)2(f, g).
In particular, for f=g,andCϕ=(2π)2gives∫R2∫R2∣(Gϕf)(ω,b)∣2dbdω=∥f∥2
L2
H(R2),this shows that the QWFT is an
isometry from L2
H(R2)intoL2
H(R2×R2),i.e., the energy of the quaternion-valued signal computed in the spatial domain
is equal to the total energy computed in the QWFT domain. They also obtain the reproducing kernel for the range to
beKϕ(ω,b;ω′,b′)=(2π)2
Cϕ(ϕω,b, ϕω′,b′).Bahri et al. in [24] explored further properties and some important inequalities
by considered the transform (331) with an extra factor (2π)2,we call it for our convenience G′
ϕf=(2π)2Gϕf.Using
the relation between the G′
ϕfand the right-sided Fourier transform authors in [24] gave the alternate proofs of these
properties. They obtained the orthogonality relation and the inversion formula depending on two window functions.
66
They also obtained the Lieb’s inequality as ∫R2∫R2∣(G′

H(R2)∥ϕ∥L2
H(R2))pfor 2≤p<∞
≥(∥f∥L2
H(R2)∥ϕ∥L2
H(R2))pfor 1≤p<2.
Authors in [29] also pointed out that the extension of the WFT to the quaternion case by means of the two-sided QFT
is complicated because of the non-commutativity. As a result, a major problem for the representation of the kernel
of the two-sided QWFT arises. Fu et al. [72] defined the two-sided QWFT of f∈L2
H(R)with respect to a non-zero
windowed function g∈L2(R2,R)as
(Qgf)(ω,b)=∫R2e−2πix1ω1f(x)g(x−b)e−2πjx2ω2dx. (332)
It can be seen from the above definition that the classical way of expressing it as a linear inner product between
function and kernel is not possible. So authors defined the right multiplicative operator C[λ,⋅]andC[⋅, λ], λbeing a
quaternion-valued function, as C[λ, f]=f(x)λ(x)andC[f, λ]=λ(x)f(x),respectively and expressed the kernel of
the QWFT as an atom operator gω,b=e2πjω2x2g(x−b)C[e2πiω1x1,⋅],ω,b,x∈R2.The kernel operator is such that for
an arbitrary function f∶R2→H,
gω,bf(x)=e2πjω2x2g(x−b)f(x)e2πiω1x1andf(x)gω,b=e−2πiω1x1g(x−b)f(x)e−2πjω2x2
and so gbeing real valued, f(x)gω,b=gω,bf(x).Thus the integral representation formula for the transform (332) as
(Qgf)(ω,b)=(f, gω,b)∶=∫R2f(x)gω,bdxand(Qgf)(ω,b)=(f, gω,b)=∫R2gω,bf(x)dx.
Authors in [72] obtained several properties of the QWFT (332) like (QPgPf)(ω,b)=(Qgf)(−ω,−b),(Qg(τx0f))(ω,b)=
e−2πix1ω1(Qgf)(ω,b−x0)e−2πjx2ω2(Qg[e2πix1ω01f(x)e2πjx2ω02])(ω,b)=(Qgf)(ω−ω0,b),ω0=(ω01, ω02).Apart from
this author also obtained the reconstruction formula
f(x)=1
Cg∫R2∫R2(Qgf)(ω,b)g−ω,bdωdb, (333)
and the orthogonality relation ⟨Qgf1,Qgf2)⟩=Cg⟨f1, f2⟩,where⟨⋅,⋅⟩is defined in (9) and Cg=∥g∥2
L2(R2,R).For more
properties and examples of QWFT (332) one can refer [65]. With the window function, g∈L2
H(R2),recently Kamel
et al. [110] considered a two sided QWFT for the function f∈L2
H(R2)as
(Ggf)(ω,b)=1
2π∫R2e−iω1x1f(x)g(x−b)e−jω2x2dx (334)
and expressed the transform in term of the two-sided QFT Fs(122) as (Ggf)(ω,b)=(Fs(fτbg))(ω)using which they
proved the orthogonality relation for QWFT (334) depending on two windowed functions g1andg2as⟨Gg1f1,Gg2f2⟩=
⟨f1(¯g1,¯g2), f2⟩,where⟨⋅,⋅⟩and(⋅,⋅)are respectively given by (9) and (8). With the assumption that the win-
dowed function gis real valued authors obtained the reconstruction formula for the transform in (334) as f(x)=

2π∥g∥2
L2(R2,R)∫R2∫R2eix1ω1(Ggf)(ω,b)g(x−b)ejx2ω2dωdband proved that the range Ggf(L2
H(R2))is a RKHS with
the kernel K(ω,b,ω′,b′)=2π
∥g∥2
L2(R2,R)(Gg(τbf))(b′,ω′−ω).Li et al. [124] expressed the two sided QWFT (332), also
given in [65], in terms of the convolution (142) for the function defined on R2and proved the linearity and anti-linearity
with respect to the real scalars, translation, scaling and parity properties along with the Parseval’s formula and with
the quaternion window they also obtained the inversion formula and characterized the range of the transform. Brahim
et al. [44] further explored the properties of the transform (334) and proved the inequality

called the Lieb’s inequality for the QWFT.
In the Cayley-Dickson form representation of the quaternion q=(a1+ib1)+j(a2+ib2), two imaginary numbers iand
jare involved. In view of the above definitions of the QWFT, it is observed that for each iandj, the Fourier kernels
e−ix1ω1ande−jx2ω2are used to define it. Thus, it is necessary to assume that fmust be a function of two variables
(or even dimension in general). Akila et al. [6] gave two definitions of the QWFT for the function defined on Rd,
which are given by
(G(1)
gf)(ω,b)=(fω⍟ˇ˜g)(b),(ω,b)∈R2d, (336)
67
and
(G(2)
gf)(ω,b)=(Gg1f1+G¯g2¯f2+j(Gg1f2+G¯g2¯f1))(ω,b) (337)
where⍟denotes the quaternion convolution given by (142), f=f1+jf2∈L2
H(Rd)with fω(x)=f(x)e−iω⋅x,ˇf(x)=
f(−x)andg=g1+jg2∈L2
H(Rd)is window function with ˜ g(x)=ˆg1(x)−jˇg2(x).Although both definitions can be
defined for the case when d=2,none of these coincides with those discussed earlier. Moreover, they are both consistent
with the WFT on L2(Rd,C).The properties like linearity, scaling and pairity given respectively by G(l)

respectively by (G(1)
g(f(x−a)))(ω,b)=(G(1)
g1f)(ω,b−a)e−ia⋅ω+(G(1)

thus the transforms maps L2

condition (2π)d∫Rd(ˆg1ˇg1+ˆg2ˇg2)=C≠0,then the following reconstruction formula holds for the transform (336)

and also considering the discrete version of the kernel of the inverse QWFT (333), authors established a new Gabor
system g−m,n∶=C[⋅, e2πim 1x1]g(x−n)e2πjm 2x2,x∈R2,m=(m1, m2),n∈Z2,which induces an orthonormal basis
with respect to the scalar inner product. Furthermore, they also proved the corresponding Balian-Low theorem,
which can be regarded as the strong version of the Heisenberg UP for the Gabor system. More precisely, if the system
{g−m,n∶m,n∈Z2}form a Gabor orthonormal basis, then

Here, ais a dilation parameter, ba translation parameter and θanSO(2)rotation parameter. It is to be noted that
the order of the terms on (340) is fixed because of the non-commutativity of the quaternion multiplication. Moreover,

with the assumption that (Fqψl)(ω), l=0,1,2,3 are real-valued, the transform (340), has the quaternion Fourier

with changes in the admissible quaternion wavelet ψ.Apart from these basic properties authors in [25] obtained the

H(R2),as a result of which it follows that, except for the factor cψ,
the transform Wψis an isometry from L2

H(G).With similar assumptions on ψas in (342), the reconstruc-
tion formula for the transform (340) is given by f(x)=1
cψ∫G(Wψf)(a, θ,b)ψa,θ,b(x)dλ(a, θ,b),where the integral
converges in the weak sense. Moreover, the range of the transform is a RKHS with the kernel Kψ(a, θ,b;a′, θ′,b′)=
1
cψ(ψa,θ,b, ψa′,θ′,b′).Bahri et al. [26], [27] studied the properties of the QWT (340) using the machinery of the QFT

when d=1.So far, we have discussed the QWT for the function with the variable in 2 or even dimension. The
QWT for the function f∈L2
H(R)can be found in [93]. He et al. [93] decomposed the space L2
H(R)=H(+,+)⊕H(−,−),
where H(+,+)={f=f1+jf2∶f1, f2∈H2

H2
+(R)={f∈L2(R)∶ˆf(ξ)=0, if ξ∉R+}and the conjugate Hardy space H2
−(R)={f∈L2(R)∶ˆf(ξ)=0, if ξ∉R−}.
They obtained the characterization of the quaternion admissible wavelet for the function ϕ∈H(+,+)(orH(−,−))as
cϕ=∫R∣ˆϕ(ξ)∣2

definition (346) is consistent with the definition of the classical WT on L2

H(R)which was not the
case when we take the definition as (346). But for definition (ˇ˜ϕa⍟f)(b),the Parseval’s formula and the inversion
formula cannot be achieved as in the case of the transform (346).
23 Quaternion Stockwell Transform (QST)
Akila et al. [4] introduced the QST for a function f=f1+jf2∈L2
H(R)with respect to ϕ=ϕ1+jϕ2∈L1
H(R)∩L2
H(R)
as
(Sϕf)(a, b)=([f]a⍟Maˇ˜ϕ)(b),(a, b)∈R+×R (348)
where[f]a(x)=f(x)e−iax,(Maf)(x)=∣a∣f(ax),˜ϕ=¯ϕ1−jˇϕ2, f∈L2
H(R)and⍟denotes the quaternion convolution
given by (142). The definition (348) can be equivalently written as
(Sϕf)(a, b)=(Sϕ1f1+Sˇ¯ϕ2ˇ¯f2+j(Sϕ1f2−Sˇ¯ϕ2ˇ¯f1))(a, b) (349)
In view of equation (349), it follows that the definition (348) is consistent with the definition of the classical WT on
L2
C(R).The transform is linear in fwith the scalars in Hand has the translation property
(Sϕ(τb0f))(a, b)=(Sϕ1(f1+jf2))(a, b−b0)−j(Sˇˆϕ2(ˇˆf2+jˇˆf2))(a, b+b0)
and the scaling property (Sϕ(f(λx)))(a, b)=(Sϕf)(a
λ, λb),forλ∈R0.Using the convolution theorem associated with
the convolution ⍟(142) and the condition that cϕ∶=∫R⋆∣ˆϕ(ξ−1)∣2
∣ξ∣dξin non-zero finite, authors obtained the Parseval’s
formula for the QST (348) for the function f, g∈L2
H(R)as
∫R∫R⋆(Sϕf)(a, b)((Sϕg)(a, b))cdadb
∣a∣=2πcϕ∫Rf(x)(g(x))cdx, (350)

H(R))is a RKHS with the kernel Kϕ(a, b;a′, b′)=
∫RΦa,b(x)(Φa′,b′(x))cdx
Kamel et al. [109] extended the definition (237) of the multidimensional ST to the quaternion valued function
f∈L2
H(R2)with respect to the window ϕ∈L1
H(R2)∩L2
H(R2).They called the transform the two-dimensional QST,
which is defined as
(Sϕf)(ξ,b)=∣detAξ∣1

where dµd(x)=dx
(2π)d
2, Aξis a 2×2 matrix diag(ξ1, ξ2), ξ1, ξ2∈R.Authors in [109] obtained some basic properties
like linearity in fwith respect to the complex scalars, anti-linearity in ϕwith respect to the quaternion scalars and
also the scaling formula (Sϕf)(ξ,b)=1
∣λ∣(Sϕf)(ξ
λ, λb), λ∈R0.Furthermore, motivated by [167], as in the case of ST
(237), author obtained the inversion formula for the transform (351), with the assumption that the window function
ϕsatisfies ∫Rϕ(x)dµ2(x)=1,asf=F−1
sASϕf,where Fsis given by (122). With the assumption that the quaternion
window ψ(and also ϕ) satisfies the conditions
(Fsψ)(ω)e−jb1ω1=e−jb2ω2(Fsψ)(ω) (352)
or
(Fs(jψ))(ω)e−jb1ω1=je−jb2ω2(Fsψ)(ω) (353)
72
authors also proved the Parseval’s formula for the QST (351) as ⟨Sϕf,Sψg⟩2,R4=⟨fC′
ϕ,ψ, g⟩2,R2,where⟨F, G⟩2,Rd=
Sc[∫RdF(t)(G(t))cdµd(t)], C′

the notation C′
ϕ=C′
ϕ,ϕandC′
ψ=C′
ψ,ψassociated respectively with two quaternion window ϕandψsatisfying (352) or
(353), it follows that for every f, g∈L2
H(R2)the function (ξ,b)→(Sψf)(ξ,b)(Sϕg)(ξ,b)belongs to Lp
H(R2×R2), p≥1

Moreover, if ϕbe an quaternion window satisfying the assumptions (352) or (353), then for every f∈L2

24 Quaternion Windowed Fractional Fourier Transform (QWFrFT)
Using the idea given in [6] for defining the QWFT (see (337)), Rajkumar [164] defined the QWFrFT for the function
f=f1+jf2∈L2
H(R)with respect to a non-zero window function g=g1+jg2∈L2
H(R)is as
(Gg,αf)(ω, b)=(Gg1,αf1+G¯g2,α¯f2+j(Gg1,αf2+G¯g2,α¯f1))(ω, b). (354)
From equation (354), it follows that the transform is consistent with the classical WFrFT (254) whenever f2=g2=0
and is H−linear on L2
H(R).Using the translation and dilation formula for the WFrFT of complex-valued functions,
author obtain the corresponding formula as
(Gg,α(τt0f))(ω, b)=(Gg,αf)(ω−t0cosα, b−t0)eit2
0
2sinαcosα−it0ωsinα
and
(Gg,α(Mω0f))(ω, b)=(Gg,αf)(ω−ω0sinα, b)eiω2
0
2sinαcoshα+iω0ωcosα,
73
where(Mω0f)(t)=e−iω0tf(t).Based on the relation (Gg,αf)(ω, b)=(Fα{f(τ)g(τ−t)})(ξ),author obtained the
Parseval’s formula (Gg,αf,Gg,αh)=∥g∥2
L2
H(R)(f, h),forf, h∈L2
H(R),as a consequence of which it follows that
∥Gg,αf∥L2
H(R×R)=∥f∥L2
H(R)∥g∥L2
H(R),here the inner product (⋅,⋅)is given by (8). Looking forward for the inversion
formula for the transform (354) author obtain the 2 −Dinversion formula for f∈L2
H(R)andg≠0 as
f(x)=1
∥g∥2
L2
H(R)∫R∫R(Gg,αf)(ω, b)K−α(x, ω)[g(x−b)]cdωdb, a.e.
Motivated by the idea of the 1 −Dinversion formula for the classical WFT [196], they also obtained the 1 −D
inversion formula for the QWFT for the function f∈L2
H(R)with assumption that g=g1+jg2∈L2
H(R)is continuous
in a neighborhood of 0 and g(0)≠0 as
f(b)=[∫R(Gg,αf)(ω, b)K−α(b, ω)dω]1
g1(0)+j¯g2(0), a.e.
It is to be noted that although the inversion formula for the classical case (255) in [196] is similar, but it lacks rigor,
because as g∈L2
C(R)its value at the single point cannot be determined. Thus to overcome this issue Rajkumar [164]
while giving the inversion in 1 −Dcase for the transform (354) considered the function g∈L2
H(R)in such a way that
gis continuous in a neighborhood of 0 and g(0)≠0.

25 Quaternion Fractional Wavelet Transform (QFrWT)
A function ψ∈L1
H(R)∩L2
H(R)is said to be a quaternion admissible wavelet if it satisfies the condition that 0 <Cψ,α∶=
∫R∣(Fαψ)(ξ)∣2
∣ξ∣dξ<∞.Roopkumar [169] introduced a QWT for the function f∈L2
H(R)with respect to the quaternion
admissible wavelet ψas

where⊗is the convolution given by (147), ψa(t)=1√
∣a∣ψ(−t
a)andUαis defined by Uα(h)=F−2αh1−jh2, h=
h1+jh2.Using the machinery of the QFrFT (145), author proved that the H−linear transform (355) satisfies
the Parseval’s identity (Wψ,αf,Wψ,αg)=2πCψ,α(f, g)forf, g∈L2

Wθ
ψf=Wθ
ψ1f1+Wθ
ˇψ2ˇf2+j(Wθ

ˇψ2ˇf1).
Thus, as a consequence of which the translation and scaling formula of the transform is given respectively by
(Wθ
ψ(τyf))(a, b)=(Wθ

and(Wθ

26 Quaternion Windowed Linear Canonical transform (QWLCT)
Due to the non-commutativity of the multiplication of quaternions, there are three different types of QWLCT de-
pending on the position of the kernel of the LCT. Gao et al. [73] introduced the two-sided QWLCT of the function

28 Quaternion Linear Canonical Stockwell Transform (QLCST)
Motivated by the definition of the ST (224) given by Stockwell et al. in [193]. Bhat and Dar [213] introduced a LCST
for aH−valued functions. For f∈L2
H(R2)andψ∈L1
H(R2)∩L2
H(R2)is a non-zero windowed function, the QLCST is
defined as
(Sij,ψ
M1,M2f)(ω,u)=∫R2Ki
M1(x1, ω1)f(x)ψ(x−u,ω)Kj
M2(x2, ω2)dx (362)

R4are parameters such that AlDl−ClDl=1,forl=1,2 and∫R2ψ(x,ω)=1,∀ω∈R2.The proposed QLCST
gives rise to a novel QFrST. The authors obtained their fundamental properties, like linearity, parity, translation, and
modulation, followed by the orthogonality relation and the reconstruction formula. They also obtained the Heisenberg

30 Conclusion
This review is a comprehensive survey of a large class of Fourier-type integral transforms. Looking at the recent
interests of researchers, it becomes extremely important for young researchers to have a collective study in this field.
Not only the Fourier transform to FrFT, LCT, or QPFT, but also the popular joint time-frequency analyzing tools such
as windowed Fourier transform, wavelet transforms, and the Stockwell transforms are generalized in the fractional
domain, linear canonical domain, and the quadratic phase domain. This survey paper contains the mathematical
properties of all these transforms and their variants. Despite many applications for some transforms, this survey
mainly focuses on their mathematical properties. Section-wise presentation for each transform makes it convenient for
readers to grasp the direction and find research gaps in the relevant area. We have tried our level best to include almost
all the variants of each transform reported in the literature. The pictorial representation given at the beginning serves
as the best tool for understanding the direction of the generalization of the transform. Despite several properties and
inequalities, like sharp Hausdorff Youngs inequality, Lieb’s inequality, Pitt’s inequality, etc., of the transformation,
this review article also presents several qualitative as well as the quantitative UPs like Heisenberg, local, logarithmic,
R´ eyni (in particular, Shannon), Lieb’s UP, etc. Apart from just giving the result obtained in the literature, we have
also tried to include the ideas of proofs in short.
Quaternion is the generalization of complex numbers. Recently, researchers have been actively involved in defining
and exploring new integral transforms for quaternion-valued functions. Generalization of the transform for functions
78
of complex-valued to quaternion-valued has fascinated researchers for the last two decades. This paper also discusses a
non-trivial generalization of the convolutions in the Fourier domain, fractional Fourier domain, linear canonical domain,
and quadratic phase Fourier domain to quaternion-valued functions defined on R.This survey paper also discusses the
ideas of defining some convolution-based wavelet, and Stockwell transforms in quaternion Fourier, fractional Fourier,
linear canonical, and quadratic phase Fourier domains. For the function of quaternion-valued defined on R2, we
observe that several transforms can be defined depending upon the positions of the kernels. This article can serve
better for the signal processing engineers in selecting an appropriate tool for the quaternion value signal analysis.
While going through the literature, we noticed that the Fourier analysis and its offshoots have also been explored
for the function of Clifford algebra valued, a generalization of the quaternion algebra. Scholars researching the
Fourier-type integral transform and its variants for Clifford algebra-valued functions will find this survey to be of
great use.

Abstract. In this article we study the fractional Hankel transform and its
inverse on certain Gel’fand-Shilov spaces of type S. The con tinuous fractional
wavelet transform is deﬁned involving the fractional Hanke l transform. The
continuity of fractional Hankel wavelet transform is discu ssed on Gel’fand-
Shilov spaces of type S. This article goes further to discuss the continuity
property of fractional Hankel transform and fractional Han kel wavelet trans-
form on the ultradiﬀerentiable function spaces.
1. Introduction
In the recent years, the continuous wavelet transform has been successfully
applied in the ﬁeld of signal processing, image encryption. The contin uous wavelet
transform of a function fassociated with the wavelet ψis deﬁned by
(Wψf)(b,a) =/integraldisplay∞
−∞f(t)ψb,a(t)dt
a,
whereψb,a(t) =ψ/parenleftBig
t−b
a/parenrightBig
,provided the integral exists, where a∈R+andb∈R. If
f,ψ∈L2(R), then exploiting the Parseval relation for Fourier transform, th e above
expression can be viewed as (see [ 1,2]):
(Wψf)(b,a) =1
2π/integraldisplay∞
−∞eibωˆf(ω)ˆψ(aω)dω,
whereˆfandˆψdenotesthe Fouriertransformof fandψrespectively. The Gel’fand-
Shilov spaces were introduced in [ 5] and studied the characterization of Fourier
transform on the aforesaid spaces. Pathak [ 18]and Holschneider [ 8] studied the
wavelet transform involving Fourier transform, on Schwartz spac eS(R). Zema-
nian [25], Lee [11] and Pathak [ 19] described the basic properties of classical
Hankel transform on the certain Gel’fand-Shilov spaces of type S. In the theory
of partial diﬀerential equations, mathematical analysis the space s of type S play an
important role as an intermediate spaces between those of C∞and of the analytic
functions. The main purpose this article is to study the fractional H ankel transform

and continuous wavelet transform associated with fractional Han kel transform on
Gel’fand-Shilov spaces of type S.
The fractional Hankel transform (FrHT), which is a generalization of the usual
Hankel transform and depends on a parameter θ, has been the focus of many
researcher as it has a wide range of applications in the ﬁeld of seismolo gy, optics,
signal processing, solving problems involving cylindrical boundaries. The fractional
Hankel transform Hθ
ν,µof a function fof orderν≥ −1
2depends on an arbitrary
real parameter µandθ(0<θ<π), is deﬁned by (see [ 9,16,17,23]):
(Hθ

0K−θ(ω,t)˜fθ(ω)dω, (1.3)
whereK−θ(ω,t) is same as Kθ(ω,t).
Let the space Lp

To deﬁne the fractional Hankel translation [ 6,12,16,17]τθ
tof a function ψ∈

ν,µ, which is deﬁned by:

Wavelets are considered to be the set of elements constructed fr om translation
and dilation of a single function ψ∈L2(R) [1,2,18]. In the similar way [ 20,24]
introduced the Bessel wavelet and the fractional Bessel wavelet by [12,15,17,20]
asψb,a,θ, which is deﬁned as below:
ψb,a,θ(t) =Da(τθ

whereDarepresents the dilation of a function.
As per [1,2,8,12,17,20], the fractional wavelet transform Wθ

Now exploiting Parseval’s relation and following [ 12,17,20], the above expression
can be rewritten as
(Wθ

According to [ 11,19], we now introduce the certain Gel’fand-Shilov spaces of type
S on which the fractional Hankel transform (1.1) and the fraction al Hankel wavlet
transform (1.9) can be studied. Let us recall the deﬁnitions of the se spaces.
Definition 1.1.The space H1,α,A(I) consists of inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable func-
tionsfonI= (0,∞) satisfying the inequality

this space the norms are given by

Definition 1.3.The space Hβ,B

∀k,q∈N0,where the constants A,B,Cν,µdepend on fandα,β,δ,σ ≥0 are
arbitrary constants. We introduce the norms in the space Hβ,B
α,A(I) as follows:
||f||ν,µ,θ= sup

Now we need to introduce the following types of test function space s [18]
Definition 1.4.The space H1,˜α,˜A(I×I), ˜α= (α1,α2),α1,α2≥0 and˜A=
(A1,A2), is deﬁned as the collection of all smooth functions f(b,a)∈I×I, such
that for all l,k,p,q∈N0,

where the constants A1,A2andCν,µ
p,qdepending on fandδ1,δ2≥0 be arbitrary
constants.
Definition 1.5.The space H2,˜β,˜B(I×I),˜β= (β1,β2),β1,β2≥0 and˜B=

where the constants A1,A2,B1,B2,Cν,µdepending on fandδ1,δ2,σ1,σ2≥0 are
arbitrary constants.
From [16,23] we have the diﬀerential operator Mν,µ,θas:
Mν,µ,θ=−e−i
2x2cotθxν−µDxei
2x2cotθxµ−ν.We shall need the following Lemma in
the proof of the Theorem 2.1.

then we obtain

Proof. Since,
Mν,µ,θ=−e−i
2x2cotθxν−µDxei
2x2cotθxµ−ν
Mν+1,µ,θMν,µ,θψ(x) =xν−µ+2e−i
2x2cotθ(x−1Dx)2xµ−νei
2x2cotθψ(x).
Proceeding in this way kthtimes, we get the required result ( i).
Now to prove ( ii),we have

Now exploiting the formula ( x−1Dx)m[x−nJn(x)] = (−1)mx−n−mJn+m(x),where
m,nbeing positive integers, the above expression becomes

This article consists of four sections. Section 1 is introductory par t, in which
several properties and fundamental deﬁnitions are given. In sec tion 2, continu-
ous fractional Hankel transform( Hθ
ν,µ) and its inverse ( H−θ
ν,µ) is studied on certain
Gel’fand-Shilov spaces of type S. Section 3 is devoted to the study o f continuous
fractional Hankel wavelet transform in the space of certain Gel’fa nd-Shilov spaces
of type S. In section 4, fractional Hankel transform and wavelet transform associ-
ated with fractional Hankel transform is investigated on ultradiﬀe rentiable function
spaces.

In this section we consider the mapping properties of the fractiona l Hankel
transform ( Hθ

linear mapping from H1,α,A(I)intoH2,2α,A2(2e)2α(I),forν≥ −1

3. The fractional wavelet transform on the spaces of type S
In this section we study the wavelet transform on the spaces of ty peS. In
order to discuss the continuity of fractional wavelet transform Wθ
ψon the aforesaid
function spaces, we need to introduce the following function space .
Definition 3.1.The space Wν,µ,θ(I),consists of all those wavelets ψ,∀n∈N0
andρ∈Rwhich satisfy
(t−1Dt)n[tµ−νei
2t2cotθHθν,µ(zν−µe−i
2z2cotθψ)(t)]<Dn,ρ(1+t)ρ−n, (3.1)
whereDn,ρis constant.
Theorem 3.2.Supposeψbe the wavelet taken from Wν,µ,θ(I). The continuous
fractional wavelet transform Wθ
ψis a continuous linear mapping from H1,α,A(I)into
H1,˜α,˜A(I×I), where˜α= (0,2α)and˜A=/parenleftBig
a,A2(2e)2α+a2/parenrightBig
.
Proof. From the deﬁnition of Wθ
ψfrom (1.9) and using (2.1), we obtain

Abstract
The nonlocal Darboux transformation of the stationary axia lly
symmetric Schr¨ odinger equation is considered. It is shown that a
special case of the nonlocal Darboux transformation provid es the gen-
eralization of the Moutard transformation. Formulae for th e gener-
alized Moutard transformation are obtained. New examples o f two -
dimensional potencials and exact solutions for the station ary axially
symmetric Schr¨ odinger equation are obtained as an applica tion of the
generalized Moutard transformation.

1 Introduction
Consider the stationary Schr¨ odinger equation in the form
(∆−u(x,y,z))Y(x,y,z) = 0
In the case u=−E+V(x,y,z) this equation describes nonrelativistic quan-
tum system with energy E[1]. In the case u=−ω2/c(x,y,z)2equation
describes an acoustic pressure ﬁeld with temporal frequency ωin inhomoge-
neous media with sound velocity c[2] and is known as Helmholtz equation
[3]. The case of ﬁxed frequency ωis of interest for modelling in acoustic to-
mography [4]. The case of ﬁxed energy Efor two - dimensional equation is of
interest for themultidimentional inverse scattering theory due to connections
with two - dimensional integrable nonlinear systems [5], [6].

In the case of axial symmetry the stationary Schr¨ odinger equat ion in
cylindrical coordinates has the form
/parenleftbigg∂2
∂r2+1
r∂
∂r+∂2
∂z2−u(r,z)/parenrightbigg
Y(r,z) = 0 (1)
The useful tool for one - dimensional Schr¨ odinger equation is the Darboux
transformation [7]. The Moutard transformation [8] is the two - dime nsional
generalization of the Darbouxtransformationfor the Schr¨ oding er equation in
cartesian coordinates. In the papers [9], [10] the nonlocal Darbou x transfor-
mation of the two - dimensional stationary Schr¨ odinger equation in cartesian
coordinates was considered and its relation to the Moutard transf ormation
was established. In the present paper we consider the stationary Schr¨ odinger
equation in cylindrical coordinates (1) using the approach of paper s [9], [10].
We use the relation of the Schr¨ odinger equation with the Fokker-P lanck
equation [11]. By the substitution
Y(r,z) =W(r,z)eh(r,z)(2)
we obtain the equation
∂
∂r/parenleftbigg

+∂
∂z(Wz+2hzW) = 0 (3)
ifuandhsatisfy the condition
u=−hrr+hr2+1

r2−hzz+hz2(4)
The equation (3) has the conservation low form that yields a pair of
equations
Wr+2hrW+1
rW−Qz= 0 (5)
Wz+2hzW+Qr= 0 (6)
As the variable Qis a nonlocal variable for the Schr¨ odinger equation (1)
the Darboux transformation for the equations (5), (6) provides the nonlocal
Darboux transformation for the Schr¨ odinger equation (1).

the generalization of the Moutard transfor-
mation

whereKer/parenleftBig
ˆL(h)/parenrightBig
={F:ˆL(h)F= 0}, then
for anyFs∈Ker/parenleftBig
ˆL(h)/parenrightBig
the function ˜F(r,z) =ˆLDFs(r,z) is a solution of
the equation ˆL/parenleftBig
˜h/parenrightBig
˜F= 0 with new potential ˜h=h+s.
In accordance with the idea of the paper [9] we deﬁne domain Fby
restriction to solutions of one equation from the system of two equ ations (5),
(6). Consider equation (7) on the following domain:
F0={F:F1r+2hrF1+1
rF1−F2z= 0}
Taking into account this dependance of F1,F2derivatives, the equations
fors,gij,aij,bijcan be obtained.
When solving equation (7) on the domain F0the special situation arise
in the case s(r,z) =−2h(r,z)−ln(r). In this case we obtain from the
equation (7) the following Darboux transformation
ˆLD=re2h(r,z)/parenleftbigg
0 1

Bytheformula(4)with ˜h=−h−ln(r)weobtainforthenewSchr¨ odinger
potential
˜u(r,z) =u(r,z)+2∂2
∂r2h(r,z)+2∂2
∂z2h(r,z)−1
r2(9)
Consider
Yh(r,z) =1
re−h(r,z)(10)
According to the formula (4), Yhis a solution of the Schr¨ odinger equation
(1) with potential u.
Then we get another form of the formula (9)
˜u(r,z) =u(r,z)−2∂2
∂r2ln(Yh(r,z))+1
r2−2∂2
∂z2ln(Yh(r,z)) (11)
This formula is the generalization of the formula of Moutard transfo rma-
tion for the potential of the Schr¨ odinger equation.
From the formula (8) and relation
˜Y(r,z) =˜W(r,z)e˜h(r,z)(12)
we have for the following equations
˜W(r,z) =re2h(r,z)Q(r,z) (13)
˜Y(r,z) =eh(r,z)Q(r,z) (14)
One can express W,Q,hby equations (2), (14), (10) trough Y,˜Y,Yhand
substitute to the system of equations (5), (6). The result is
∂

Yh(r,z)˜Y(r,z)/parenrightBig

These formulae are the generalization of the formulae of the Mouta rd
transformation for the solution of the Schr¨ odinger equation.
Thus the case ˜h=−h−ln(r) of the nonlocal Darboux transformation
for the stationary axially symmetric Schr¨ odinger equation provide s the gen-
eralization of the Moutard transformation .
Note that Y=Yh,˜Y= (rYh)−1is the simple example of solution for
equations (15), (16).

formation
For the ﬁrst example of of the generalized Moutard transformatio n applica-
tion let us consider u= 0,Yh=r2−2z2,Y=z. From the equations (11),
(15), (16) we obtain potencial
˜u1=4z4+13r4+20r2z2

and solution of equation (1) with this potential

whereC1is an arbitrary constant. The potencial (17) has singularities wher e
its denominator vanishes.
In the case of the two - dimensional Schr¨ odinger equation in carte sian
coordinates the twofold application of the Moutard transformatio n can be
eﬀective for obtaining nonsingular potentials [12], [10]. Let us continu e our
example andmake the second generalized Moutardtransformation . Consider
u= ˜u1,Yh=˜Y1. From the equation (11) we obtain potencial
˜˜u1=−8r2/parenleftBig
(r2−5z2)2−33z4/parenrightBig
−8C1(5r2+2z2)
(4r2z2+r4+C1)2.(18)
This potential is nonsingular if C1>0.
To illustrate the obtaining of solutions for the stationary axially sym-
metric Schr¨ odinger equation by the generalized Moutard transfo rmation let

us derive the solution of equation (1) with potential (18) from the s olution
Ys=1√
r2+z2with potential u= 0. Let us consider Yh=r2−2z2,Y=Ys.
From the equations (15), (16) we obtain the solution of equation (1 ) with
potential (17)
˜Ys=rz
(r2−2z2)√
r2+z2(19)
Then consider Yh=˜Y1,Y=˜Ysand get from the equations (15), (16) the
following solution of equation (1) with potential (18)
˜˜Ys=3r4−C1√
r2+z2(4r2z2+r4+C1)(20)
The integration constant arising is set to zero.
In the case u<0 equation (1) coincides with Helmholtz equation for
axially symmetric medium. For the second example of of the generalize d
Moutardtransformationapplicationletusconsider u=−k2,Yh= sin(kz),Y=
cos(kz). From the equations (11), (15), (16) we obtain potencial
˜u2=−k2+1
r2+2k2
(sin(kz))2(21)
and solution of equation (1) with this potential
˜Y2=r2+C2
rsin(kz)
whereC2is an arbitrary constant. Let us make the second generalized
Moutard transformation. Consider u= ˜u2,Yh=˜Y2. From the equation
(11) we obtain potencial
˜˜u2=−k2+4
(r2+C2)−8C2
(r2+C2)2. (22)
This potential evidently satisﬁes ˜˜u2<0 ifC2>4k−2. The simple example
of solution ( rYh)−1for potencial (22) is
˜˜Y2=sin(kz)
r2+C2.

4 Results and Discussion
The stationary Schr¨ odinger equation in the case of axial symmetr y is inves-
tigated. Using the approach of the papers [9], [10] the nonlocal Dar boux
transformation of the two - dimensional stationary Schr¨ odinger equation in
cylindrical coordinates is considered. It is shown that a special cas e of the
nonlocal Darboux transformation provides the generalization of t he Moutard
transformation. Formulae for the generalized Moutard transfor mation are
obtained. New examples of two - dimensional potencials and exact so lutions
for the stationary axially symmetric Schr¨ odinger equation are obt ained as an
application of the generalized Moutard transformation.
The generalized Moutard transformation can be initiated by any exa ct
solution and applied repeatedly. Thus further application of the gen eralized
Moutard transformation can provide a lot of new examples of poten cials and
exact solutions for the stationary axially symmetric Schr¨ odinger e quation.
