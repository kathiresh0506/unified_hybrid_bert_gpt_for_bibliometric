Abstract
Incident management is a classical topic in cyber security. Recently, the European Union (EU) has started to consider
also the relation between cyber security incidents and cyber security crises. These considerations and preparations,
including those specified in the EU’s new cyber security laws, constitute the paper’s topic. According to an analysis of
the laws and associated policy documents, (i) cyber security crises are equated in the EU to large-scale cyber security
incidents that either exceed a handling capacity of a single member state or affect at least two member states. For this
and other purposes, (ii) the new laws substantially increase mandatory reporting about cyber security incidents, including
but not limited to the large-scale incidents. Despite the laws and new governance bodies established by them, however,
(iii) the working of actual cyber security crisis management remains unclear particularly at the EU-level. With these
policy research results, the paper advances the domain of cyber security incident management research by elaborating
how European law perceives cyber security crises and their relation to cyber security incidents, paving the way for many
relevant further research topics with practical relevance, whether theoretical, conceptual, or empirical.
Keywords: risk management, risk analysis, incident management, crisis management, regulations, governance, EU
1. Introduction
“Europe has been in crisis management mode for a
decade and a half” (Handler, 2024, p. 1). Although the
statement quoted is true in many respects, it does not
(yet) apply to the cyber security domain. In other words,
to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has not been a
truly large-scale, pan-European cyber security crisis thus
far. This statement does not mean that the EU would
not have prepared for such a crisis. These preparations,
including those mandated by the EU’s new cyber security
laws, are what the paper is about. The paper’s relevance
and contributions can be elaborated with four brief points.
To start from practical relevance, first, the topic is
timely. In fact, the European Commission (EC) just re-
cently released a new proposal for handling large-scale,
cross-country cyber security crises in Europe (EC, 2025a).
The second point follows from this timeliness; again to
the best of the authors’ knowledge, the paper is the first
to elaborate cyber security crisis management in the EU
context. While there are some existing works, they have
concentrated on national cyber security crisis manage-
ment (Boeke, 2017; Collier, 2016; Østby and Katt, 2020).
That is, the EU context has been missing thus far, includ-
ing with respect to the EU’s new judicial framework. In

received limited attention in general (B´ eland et al., 2024).
Subsequently, third, the paper contributes to the recent ef-
forts to digest and analyze the EU’s many new cyber secu-
rity laws and their implications (Alexopoulos et al., 2025;
Busetti and Scanni, 2025; Mueck and Gaie, 2025; Rataj,
2025; Ruohonen, 2024b; Ruohonen et al., 2025, among
many others). Regarding existing research and knowledge
more generally, fourth and last, the paper contributes to
the incident management research domain by elaborating,
analyzing, and theorizing on how incidents are related to
and may transform into crises. Because crises typically
have immense consequences, the paper’s overall relevance
is well-justified; it is important to understand how the
EU’s new cyber security legal framework is designed with
crisis management in mind.
With respect to the last point, both incident manage-
ment research and frameworks for it have traditionally op-
erated at the organizational level; incidents are something
that organizations may face, and thus they should also pre-
pare for them. For instance, a classical incident manage-
ment framework from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) defines cyber security incident as
“a violation or imminent threat of violation” of any cy-
ber “security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard
security practices” established and enforced by organiza-
tions (Cichonski et al., 2012, p. 6). The organizational fo-
cus is thus clear. According to an early literature review,
Preprint submitted to Elsevier April 22, 2025arXiv:2504.14220v1  [cs.CR]  19 Apr 2025
a similar focus is present in many other well-known frame-
works and standards for incident management and closely
related topics (Tøndel et al., 2014). From the previous
quotation it also follows that an organization should have
cyber security policies established and enforced because
otherwise an incident remains only implicit and vaguely
defined. A similar claim applies to cyber security crisis
management; also larger entities, whether industry sec-
tors, geographic regions, or countries and beyond, should
have policies in place for handling cyber security crises.
As will be seen, in the EU these policies are partially but
still explicitly written in recent cyber security laws.
A further point about the organizational focus is that it
has typically been present also in different socio-technical
frameworks for incident management and cyber security
management in general (Al Sabbagh and Kowalski, 2015;
Jaatun et al., 2009; van Haastrecht et al., 2021). Moti-
vated by a recent work on layered cyber security frame-
works (Panteli et al., 2025), the paper adopts a multi-level
perspective sometimes used in the socio-technical frame-
works (Malatji et al., 2019), but extends it beyond orga-
nizations. Thus, the first part in the socio-technical term
refers to an adjective societal and particularly a noun Eu-
ropean. Although societal cyber security is not a well-
defined concept, it has sometimes been discussed in a con-
text of critical infrastructure protection (Gjesvik, 2019).
Such a framing serves also the paper’s purposes well be-
cause among the EU laws considered is an important new
law for critical infrastructure protection in Europe.
With these motivating remarks in mind, the following
three research questions (RQs) are examined:
•RQ.1: What constitutes a cyber security crisis in the
European Union?
•RQ.2: What do recent EU laws impose upon cyber
security incident and crisis management?
•RQ.3: How cyber security crises are managed, gov-
erned, and coordinated in the EU and by whom?
The paper’s remainder is structured into four sections.
The opening Section 2 motivates the background further,
including with respect to the multi-level approach pursued
and the EU laws considered. The methodology for analyz-
ing these is also elaborated, and a few clarifying framings
are also done to restrict and limit the paper’s scope. Sec-
tion 3 continues by elaborating how different law-imposed
incident types are related to the multi-level approach. In
general, the section answers to RQ.1 and RQ.2. The sub-
sequent Section 4 answers to RQ.3 by elaborating the var-
ious institutions, organizations, and networks involved in
cyber security crisis management in the EU context. The
final Section 5 presents a concluding discussion.2. Background
2.1. Framings
Some framings are required for limiting and aligning
the paper’s scope to a manageable composition. To be-
gin with, the paper is framed toward cyber security alone.
The paper’s opening quotation about Europe having been
in a crisis management mode for a long time helps to un-
derstand that crises vary a lot; from financial crises all
the way to wars and the existential climate change crisis.
While notions such as cascading effects and risks (Adkins
et al., 2020; Ruohonen, 2024a; Ruohonen et al., 2025) make
it understandable that many crises may be interconnected
to each other, no attempts are made to connect cyber se-
curity crises to other crises. The same applies regarding
threats. Some cyber security threats, including particu-
larly those related to advanced persistent threat (APT) ac-
tors, are today, in Europe, often perceived to be linked
with a broader class of so-called hybrid threats (Anagnos-
takis, 2023; Jungwirth et al., 2023). While acknowledging
the linkage’s theoretical and practical validity, no attempts
are made to move beyond plain cyber security. By implica-
tion, as hybrid threats may involve also a military dimen-
sion, also the EU’s other cyber security pillars (Christou,
2016; Ruohonen, 2024b), whether cyber defense or data
protection, are excluded from the paper’s scope. Further-
more, theorizing about different types of cyber security
crises are further omitted for brevity, clarity, and align-
ment with the EU’s laws.
With respect to large-scale cyber security crises, ENISA
(2024, p. 12) emphasizes a need to distinguish between a
creeping crisis, “which simmers under the radar” before
“suddenly and unexpectedly erupting”, an acute crisis,
“which is sudden, unforeseen and can have a massive im-
pact in a very short amount of time”, and a recurring cri-
sis, which occurs almost continuously. Similar categoriza-
tions have been presented in the academic literature (Boin
et al., 2018; Head, 2022). Of these three types, denial of
service attacks, in particular, could be seen as something
recurrent, whereas a severe data breach or a successful
ransomware attack might be seen to belong to the cate-
gory of acute crises. Though, these examples are more
about incidents than crises; therefore, also risk analysis is
presumably more challenging when trying to assess crises
rater than incidents; when operating at a level of societies
or beyond rather than at the conventional organizational
level. At the societal level, an example of a creeping crisis
might involve a discovered large-scale espionage campaign
conducted by an APT actor. Beyond these brief remarks,
as said, more elaborate theorization is left for further work.
2.2. Methodology
The paper operates in the domain of policy studies.
Within this domain, a separation between policy analysis
and policy (process) research is sometimes done. Broadly
2
speaking, the former is about prescriptive research seek-
ing to inform policy-making, whether in terms of evalua-
tions, impact assessments, or something else, while the lat-
ter is descriptive research focused particularly on theory-
building (DeLeon and Weible, 2010; Secchi, 2016). Given
this characterization, the paper is about policy research.
Regarding descriptive policy research, an ex post ,post hoc ,
or retrospective approach is used (cf. Patton et al., 2016).
This choice is also unavoidable because the EU laws con-
sidered have already been enacted.
Regarding ex ante policy analysis, it is worth remarking
that the EC did prior impact assessments for most—but
not all (EP, 2024)—of the laws considered in the paper.
For the paper’s purposes, it is particularly worth remark-
ing that these assessments indicated a lack of joint situa-
tional awareness and crisis management between the mem-
ber states, and between them and the EU-level administra-
tion; information sharing was concluded to operate on an
ad hoc basis and cross-border spillovers were omitted from
risk analyses (EC, 2020, pp. 21–22). This point justifies an
academic expert evaluation of the three RQs postulated.
Regarding theory-building, the paper analyzes and the-
orizes how the EU’s new laws align with common analyt-
ical frameworks used in incident and crisis management
research. On the side of engineering and computer sci-
ence, within which theory-building often has a different
meaning, the paper aligns with requirements engineering
research within which legal requirements are a distinct
genre (Ruohonen et al., 2025). This research branch jus-
tifies RQ.2. In other words, it is important to know what
laws require, whether from organizations, producers, or
public administrations. Once an answer is known, it is pos-
sible to continue toward empirical policy research; with-
out knowing the legal requirements, formulation of rele-
vant research questions is difficult—if not questionable al-
together. This point also applies to the framings done; in-
sofar as policy analysis is concerned, it is pointless to eval-
uate responses to hybrid threats without knowing about
the preparations and frameworks for handling them.
2.3. Analytical Levels
The paper’s conceptual and theoretical background can
be motivated by considering an analytical relation be-
tween incidents and crisis through different vertical levels
of analysis often used in social sciences. A term multi-
level analysis is sometimes used to refer to approaches
that operate at two or more such levels (B´ eland et al.,
2024; Hutzschenreuter et al., 2020). The term should not
be equated to multi-level (cyber) security, although there
is a rough conceptual similarity because both involve a hi-
erarchy (Anderson, 2020). In any case, an incident that
involves multiple analytical levels could be called a multi-
level incident—or, depending on which levels an incident
has transcended, a cyber security crisis.2.3.1. The International Level
The international level is at the top of the hierarchy.
When operating at this level, an analysis typically func-
tions horizontally, focusing on relations between states. In
terms of cyber security, good examples about such inter-
state, transnational relations would cover cyber norms, cy-
ber diplomacy, and even what is known and debated as
cyber war. However, as said, such topics are beyond the
paper’s scope. Another point is that it is also possible
to consider information systems and other technical solu-
tions at this level; such systems and solutions are those
that transcend both national and organizational bound-
aries (Rukanova et al., 2015). Such transcendence can also
been seen as something that separates cyber security inci-
dents from cyber security crises.
If a cyber security incident escalates to the international
level, it is not really any more a mere incident but rather
a crisis. With this point in mind, Fig. 1 displays seven an-
alytical levels through which incidents may become crises.
As can be seen, the impact is taken to increase the further
a cyber security event is from an incident.

2.3.2. The Supranational Level
Below the international level is a supranational level.
This level is at which the EU operates; the European
Union is a supranational union. At the same time, how-
ever, it operates in intergovernmental terms; the Council
of the European Union would be the prime example in this
regard. In contrast, the European Union Agency for Cy-
bersecurity (ENISA) operates at the supranational level,
although intergovernmental tenets may still be present in
terms of staffing and related aspects. While there is a
classical debate regarding the meaning of and interplay be-
tween these two theoretical governance terms (Bickerton
et al., 2022; Handler, 2024; Tsebelis and Garrett, 2021),
without a particular loss of specificity and rigor, the term
supranationalism is used in case there is no particular rea-
son to emphasize the intergovernmental dimension.
Note also a difference between the terms transnational
and intergovernmental; the latter is about relations be-
tween governments, as is the case in the Council in which
ministers or other heads of states represent their mem-
3
ber states, whereas the former can be seen to cover also
supranational governance because the meaning is essen-
tially about relations between nations. These relations
may be about states, but they may also include transna-
tional non-governmental organizations, different transna-
tional collaboration and coordination networks, and inter-
national organizations (G¨ anzle et al., 2022). When such
transnational relations are accounted for, the term multi-
level governance can be seen to cover also a horizontal
dimension; a coordination and collaboration between dif-
ferent entities not directly linked to governmental repre-
sentatives. These terminological clarifications are impor-
tant because the EU’s overall multi-level crisis manage-
ment framework covers numerous actors operating at dif-
ferent governance levels and policy areas (Anagnostakis,
2023). The concepts also provide a theoretical foundation
for analyzing the EU’s cyber security crisis management
framework in terms of governance and coordination.
2.3.3. The National, Regional, and Sectoral Levels
When taking a step downwards from the supranational
level, the national level is encountered. Regarding gover-
nance, authoritative computer security incident response
teams (CSIRTs) are particularly relevant in Europe; ac-
cording to both old and new EU laws, each member state
should have an authoritative CSIRT or a related com-
petent authority for nationwide incident management.1
However, presently it remains still somewhat unclear how
national administrations are, or will be, arranged in each
and every member state. By hypothesis, the divergence is,
or will be, large across the twenty-seven member states.
Although there are no clear demarcations, operations at
the national level are sometimes (but not always) about
crisis management rather than incident management. The
same could be said even about the regional level, espe-
cially when keeping in mind that it includes both smaller
geographically bound administrative units as well as larger
geographic units, such as is the case in the Germany’s fed-
eralist administration. Also crisis management tends to
be decentralized to the regional, L¨ ander , level in Germany,
although strategic management and high-level political co-
ordination occurs at the federal level (Christensen et al.,
2016). Without the federalist twist, the setup is rather
similar to many other European countries within which
strategic and political aspects are oftentimes centralized,
while the operational level is often more or less decen-
tralized (Christensen et al., 2016; Gjesvik, 2019; Ramsell
and Wihlborg, 2012). Regions also intervene with indus-
try sectors in many member states. Whether an exam-
ple is about the Ruhr region in Germany or the Emilia-
Romagna region in Italy, specialized industry activity has
1Here, the adjective authoritative is used for emphasizing a dif-
ference to other CSIRTs, including sectoral teams as well as teams
within organizations and companies. Note also that in practice the
abbreviation CSIRT is equivalent to an abbreviation CERT, denot-
ing a computer emergency response team.often concentrated to specific regions in Europe and also
elsewhere. Authoritative CSIRTs in some European coun-
tries have also been decentralized with sectoral special-
ization in mind (Boin et al., 2018). In terms of incident
management, many industries also have different sectoral
and regional coordination networks and governance hubs.
2.3.4. The Organizational and Individual Levels
Then, below the sectoral level is the organizational
level. As said in the introduction, this level has been
the traditional focal point in incident management and
its research. Again, coordination may occur horizon-
tally between organizations (inter-organizational coordi-
nation) and within organizations (intra-organizational co-
ordination), and vertically between organizations and in-
dividuals (Heine, 2019; Panteli et al., 2025). The intra-
organizational coordination is relevant also for establish-
ing organizational CSIRTs; typical choices for large orga-
nizations include outsourcing, a centralized organization-
wide team, or distributed teams across an organization’s
departments (Mitropoulos et al., 2006; Cichonski et al.,
2012). Organizations may also coordinate vertically with
sectoral or regional entities, such as industry associations,
as well as entities operating at a national level, including
authoritative CSIRTs in particular. Finally, as seen from
Fig. 1, it is also possible to consider incidents at a level
of individuals, whether employees, citizens, or consumers.
Given the extensive research and evidence on the human
factors in cyber security, it is also possible that an incident
affecting an individual escalates to the organizational level
or even beyond that.
2.3.5. An Example of a Multi-Level Incident
A good example about a multi-level incident would be
the attacks against Danish energy sector companies in
2023. Given that over twenty energy sector companies
were compromised, the incident prompted also interna-
tional media attention (Antoniuk, 2023). Regarding the
analytical levels, the example is illuminating because it
involved three or four levels in Fig. 1.
To begin with, the incident was not only organizational
but also sectoral due to the involvement of multiple com-
panies in the same sector. Given the potential concen-
tration of the energy sector companies to some particular
regions in Denmark, the incident could be perhaps inter-
preted to involve also the regional level. In any case, the
sectoral level manifested itself also in the investigation con-
ducted by SektorCERT (2023), a non-profit CSIRT com-
posed by Danish critical infrastructure companies and op-
erators. The investigation revealed that the compromises
were conducted by exploiting a vulnerability in a firewall
product.2Furthermore, an update had been available but
the energy sector companies had not patched their firewalls
for a reason or another. During the incident management,
the issue escalated further to the national level.
2CVE-2023-28771.

Among other things, CFCS (2023), the authoritative
CSIRT in Denmark, raised the threat level against the
Danish energy sector to the very high level category. How-
ever: while multiple levels were involved, the incident is
not yet something that could be interpreted as a cyber se-
curity crisis according to the EU’s laws. This point will
become clear in Subsection 3.1 that elaborates different
incident types present in the recently enacted EU laws.
2.4. The EU’s Strategy
The EU’s new cyber security strategy can be sum-
marized in the form of Fig. 2. Three of the strategy’s
pillars—prevention, detection, and response—resemble
rather similar phases in incident management frameworks.
For instance, the NIST’s noted framework is structured
around preparation, detection and analysis, containment,
eradication, and recovery, and post-incident phases (Ci-
chonski et al. 2012; cf. also Mitropoulos et al. 2006).
Rather analogously, ENISA (2024) builds upon preven-
tion, preparedness, and response and recovery phases. An-
other example would be prepare, detect and recover, and
learn (Jaatun et al., 2009). A further point is that the
EU’s strategy is structured around specific laws, which
are also supported by funding instruments, education, re-
search, development, and innovation projects, and specific
governance bodies, some of which are new.

Figure 2: The EU’s Current Cyber Security Strategy in a Nutshell
(adopted from EC 2025b)
Before continuing to enumerate the laws covered, it
should be emphasized that there are many further EU laws
explicitly or implicitly related to cyber security, some of
which are sector-specific and some others of which over-
lap with each other (EC, 2025a; Fischer-H¨ ubner et al.,
2021; Ruohonen et al., 2025). Against this backdrop, it is
no wonder that regulatory fragmentation and complexity
have been a source of commonly expressed criticism (Alex-
opoulos et al., 2025; Ruohonen, 2024b). In any case, it
should be emphasized that the specific laws considered
are particularly relevant for the paper’s topic. In other
words, as will elaborated in Section 3, the laws also help
to understand how a transcendence from an incident to a
unionwide crisis is legally perceived and structured.
Of the four laws abbreviated in Fig. 2, particularly im-
portant are the so-called NIS2 directive (EU, 2022) and
the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) regulation (EU, 2024).Although a concept of essential and important entities
(EAIEs) is used in the NIS2 directive, the directive is es-
sentially about critical infrastructure protection. Overall,
the directive builds upon a sectoral approach; numerous
sectors are enumerated as carrying “critical societal or eco-
nomic activities”, to quote from the NIS2’s Article 2(2)(b).
This quotation aligns with the notion of societal cyber se-
curity noted in the introduction. The actual sectors spec-
ified range from traditional critical infrastructure sectors,
such as energy and transport, to banking, healthcare, fi-
nance, drinking and waste water management, the Inter-
net’s core infrastructure, and space technologies.
In contrast, the CRA regulation is a product-specific
law; among other things, it specifies so-called essential cy-
ber security requirements for almost all information tech-
nology products. As these requirements have already been
considered in detail (Ruohonen et al., 2025), including
with respect to new obligations regarding vulnerability co-
ordination and disclosure (Ruohonen and Timmers, 2024),
in what follows, the CRA is only discussed with respect to
its mandates for incident reporting. Having said that, it
is worth remarking that the CRA’s essential requirement
about preferably automated security updates would have
prevented the Danish energy sector case noted earlier in
Subsection 2.3.5, and, furthermore, some of the essential
requirements contain also elements aligning with the tech-
nical detection and prevention of incidents.
Regarding the CRA more generally, also the older Cy-
bersecurity Act (CSA) can be mentioned (EU, 2019).
While it strengthened the role and mandates of ENISA,
it also introduce a common cyber security certification
scheme for information technology products. This certi-
fication scheme aligns with the CRA in that conformance
can be attained also (but not only) through certification.
Given that standards are also an important part of the
CRA and compliance with it, the regulation seems to have
at least partially answered to criticism from the industry
and practitioners (Fischer-H¨ ubner et al., 2021). Finally,
recently a new Cyber Solidarity Act (CSOA) regulation
was agreed upon (EU, 2025). As can be seen from Fig. 2,
it covers aspects from all the three pillars noted earlier.
A couple of additional remarks are in order before con-
tinuing to elaborate the laws and their implications in de-
tail. The first remark is that deterring of cyber security
threats appears in Fig. 2. While this topic is beyond the
paper’s scope, it can be noted that deterrence has long
been debated in the literature (Goodman, 2010, among
many others), some authors having taken a critical stance
about the working of deterrence in the cyber security con-
text (among them Soesanto and Smeets, 2021). The sec-
ond remark is that all of the laws are more or less risk-
based, some explicitly and some only implicitly. In partic-
ular, the NIS2 directive’s Article 21 obliges EAIEs to carry
out comprehensive risk analyses. These should be done by
following a so-called “all-hazards” approach, which is also
familiar from the academic literature (Ayyub et al., 2007;
Izumi, 2024). According to NIS2, the approach means that
5
anything and everything from incident handling, backups,
and supply-chain security to security awareness campaigns
and business continuity should be assessed. The CRA too
is a risk-based regulation; the essential cyber security re-
quirements should be prioritized, designed, implemented
against particular, product-specific risks identified.
3. Incident Types
3.1. Events
Events, including alerts, whether from intrusion detec-
tion systems, other monitoring systems, or somewhere
else, are important building blocks for incident manage-
ment (Cichonski et al., 2012). These also allow under-
standing how incidents may transform into crises accord-
ing to the EU’s jurisprudence. Thus, Fig. 3 displays the
core event types in the new EU laws. The figure can be
elaborated by moving from the bottom to the top, from
alerts to incidents, severe incidents, and beyond. In line
with the previous discussion, at least the last incident type
shown is analytically already on the side of crises.

Figure 3: An Event Type Hierarchy
As was remarked in Subsection 2.4, the CRA’s essen-
tial cyber security requirements for products contain el-
ements that may (or should) foster the detection cyber
security incidents. For instance, the requirements include
a monitoring functionality for a product’s internal activ-
ity, including with respect to authorizations and integrity
guarantees (Ruohonen et al., 2025). In addition, as seen
also from the earlier Fig. 2, the CSOA regulation is rele-
vant too with respect to incident detection. In particular,
the regulation envisions a development of a large-scale,
pan-European network of cyber security alert systems for
coordinated incident detection and improved situational
awareness capabilities. While these systems are labeled as
“cyber hubs” in the regulation, they are essentially what
security operation centers (SOCs) and threat intelligence
systems in general are about. The network is planned
upon voluntary pooling of national alert systems into large
cross-border systems. The national systems may include
not only those maintained by authoritative CSIRTs but
also those operated by private sector companies.3.1.1. Near Misses
An alert can be a false positive or a true positive. Al-
though the NIST’s definition noted in the introduction
covers both, for the present purposes, it makes sense to
frame incidents only toward true positives. Regarding false
positives, the EU’s recent laws introduce a concept of near
misses. A near miss is defined in the NIS2’s Article 6(5)
to mean “an event that could have compromised the avail-
ability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of stored,
transmitted or processed data or of the services offered
by, or accessible via, network and information systems,
but that was successfully prevented”. Thus, within the
context of incident management, the concept can be seen
to be about false positives; about alerts that were suc-
cessfully prevented from becoming actual incidents (true
positives). In any case, reporting about near misses is vol-
untary. According to Article 15(2) in the CRA regulation,
manufacturers and other parties, whether natural or le-
gal persons, may voluntarily report near misses either to
a national authoritative CSIRT or ENISA. Likewise, ac-
cording to Article 30 in the NIS2 directive, EAIEs may
voluntary report near misses to a authoritative CSIRT or
some related public sector authority.
Voluntary reporting seems sensible already due to over-
head and related reasons. Because alerts are voluminous
due to various monitoring systems deployed by organiza-
tions, most of them are false positives, and interoperability
is a typical issue with the monitoring systems and their re-
porting formats (Alahmadi et al., 2022; Zibak et al., 2022).
Analogously to abuse reporting in the Internet (Jhaveri
et al., 2017), a signal to noise ratio is often also low.
Against these backdrops, a mandatory reporting of near
misses would have presumably required large financial in-
vestments and considerable coordination between various
stakeholders involved, including the authoritative Euro-
pean CSIRTs and producers of cyber security monitoring
solutions. The issues with false positives in the cyber secu-
rity context are well-recognized in the literature also more
generally; not only is a minimization of them generally
difficult but also a cost of handling them is often signifi-
cant (Bhatt et al., 2014). However, the EU laws do not say
anything how organizations should actually demarcate be-
tween false and true positives, and whether there are any
consequences from accidentally reporting a false positive
as a true positive or the other way around.
3.1.2. Incidents
Also reporting of most (but not all) true positives—that
is, according to the terminology adopted, incidents—is vol-
untary. According to the NIS2’s Article 6(6), an incident
is defined as “an event compromising the availability, au-
thenticity, integrity or confidentiality of stored, transmit-
ted or processed data or of the services offered by, or acces-
sible via, network and information systems”. When com-
pared to the earlier definition for near misses, an incident
is thus something that has actually compromised data or
6
services. While the definition aligns with classical fram-
ings (Brownlee and Guttman, 1998), there is a difference
to the NIST’s definition noted in the introduction is also
present. Although availability, authenticity, integrity, and
confidentiality may well belong to an organization’s cyber
security policy, the NIS2 only notes, in Article 24, cyber
security policies with respect to open source software asso-
ciations. In any case, according to the NIS2’s Article 30,
reporting of these “conventional” incidents is voluntary.
3.1.3. Severe Incidents
When moving a step upward in the event hierarchy
(see Fig. 3), the CRA regulation (but not the NIS2 direc-
tive) uses a concept of severe incidents. It is mandatory
to report such incidents to both a national authoritative
CSIRT and ENISA according to the CRA’s Article 14(3).
A twofold definition for severe incidents is given in the reg-
ulation’s Article 14(5). The first part emphasizes negative
impacts andpotential negative impacts upon a product’s
ability to protect the availability, authenticity, integrity,
or confidentiality of data or services, whereas the second
part emphasizes an execution and a potential execution
of malicious code. It remains to be seen how manufac-
turers will interpret the demarcation between the impacts
and executions on one hand and the potential impacts and
executions on the other hand.
Another important point is that the CRA is about man-
ufacturers of information technology products, not about
operators of such products, including EAIEs covered by
the NIS2 directive. With some relaxations, manufacturers
are also mandated to report about actively exploited vul-
nerabilities (Ruohonen and Timmers, 2024). In any case,
the divergence between the scopes of the two EU laws
reiterates a criticism expressed in the literature about a
lack of an explicit legal synchronization between different
reporting obligations imposed by different laws (Fischer-
H¨ ubner et al., 2021; Ruohonen, 2024a). In particular, in
case a manufacturer reports to a national authoritative
CSIRT and ENISA about a severe incident, either the
given CSIRT or ENISA, or both, should presumably con-
sequently report to all EAIEs and others using the man-
ufacturer’s given product to which the severe incident ap-
plies. Again, it remains to be seen how such consecutive
reporting will work in practice.
3.1.4. Significant Incidents
The remaining two incident types are specified in the
NIS2 directive. According to the directive’s Article 23(3),
a significant incident either “has caused or is capable of
causing severe operational disruption of the services or fi-
nancial loss for the entity concerned”, or it “has affected
or is capable of affecting other natural or legal persons by
causing considerable material or non-material damage”.
The again twofold definition warrants three brief remarks.
The first remark is related to the earlier point about
potential effects; the wording “capable of” yet again en-
tails a demarcation problem between actual significant in-cidents and those merely conveying a probability of such
incidents. Presently, no guidance is available upon this
demarcation (Busetti and Scanni, 2025). The second re-
mark is related to the wording about “severe operational
disruption”. Here, it would seem that anything from se-
vere denial of service attacks to severe ransomware attacks
are in the scope. The definition’s emphasis of severe finan-
cial losses further underlines ransomware attacks, although
also other so-called destructive cyber attacks are likely in
the NIS2’s scope. The third remark is about the empha-
sis about “considerable material or non-material damage”
to natural persons. Therefore, it has been suspected that
also severe personal data breaches are in the directive’s
scope (Ruohonen et al., 2025), but a definite conclusion
can likely be given only after guidelines have been released
or enforcement has occurred. While keeping these and
other potential interpretation issues in mind, EAIEs must
report about significant incidents to a national authorita-
tive CSIRTs or, where applicable, other public authorities,
as well as other entities concerned according to the NIS2’s
Article 23(1). Thus, broadly speaking, unlike “conven-
tional” incidents, significant incidents fall into a category
of mandatory reporting by EAIEs.
3.1.5. Large-Scale Incidents
Finally, there is the notion about large-scale cyber se-
curity incidents. A large-scale incident is defined in the
NIS2 directive’s Article 6(7) as an incident which either
(a) exceeds a handling capacity of a single member state
or which (b) has a significant impact on at least two mem-
ber states. Regarding incident management frameworks,
the first part of the definition resembles a concept of esca-
lation at the organizational level; an organizational CSIRT
or some related security team cannot get an incident under
control on its own (cf. Jaatun et al., 2009). Another point
is that the EC’s (2025a, p. 12) noted recent proposal clar-
ifies that these large-scale incidents are what is meant by
a cyber security crisis in the EU context. While keeping
the earlier remarks about terminology in mind, a cyber
security crisis is thus something that moves from the na-
tional level to the supranational level in Fig. 1. Also the
NIS2’s recital 69 clarifies this point by noting that large-
scale incidents “may escalate and turn into fully-fledged
crises”. Despite such an escalation potential and interest-
ingly enough, NIS2 does not explicitly say about reporting
obligations of large-scale incidents, but because these must
be something that also satisfy the definition for significant
incidents, reporting can be interpreted as mandatory.
The CSOA’s cyber security alert systems noted in Sub-
section 3.1 are also related to large-scale cyber security
incidents. According to the regulation’s Article 7, partic-
ularly the envisioned cross-border alert systems are seen
as relevant for detecting large-scale incidents and shar-
ing information about them. There are also a couple of
other important points to make about the relation between
large-scale incidents and the CSOA regulation.
The first point is about the exceeding of a member
7
state’s handling capacity used in the definition for a large-
scale cyber security incident. Here, the CSOA’s Article 14
specifies an establishment of a specific cyber security “re-
serve” for handling large-scale incidents. The reserve is
composed by national public sector representatives as well
as other trusted parties. According to Article 15, a mem-
ber state in need may then request help from the reserve
to recover from both significant and large-scale cyber secu-
rity incidents. Furthermore, the CSOA’s Article 19 spec-
ifies that help can be requested also by countries outside
of the EU, provided that they are taking part in the EU’s
Digital Europe Programme (DEP), a funding instrument
for digital technologies and digitalization in general.
The second point is that the CSOA specifies a new cyber
security incident review mechanism. Its scope is restricted
to significant and large-scale incidents. ENISA and a net-
work of authoritative CSIRT are specified as the respon-
sible parties for the actual reviews according to the regu-
lation’s Article 21(1). In line with the post-incident activ-
ities in the NIST’s incident management framework (Ci-
chonski et al., 2012), the reviews are used for improving the
union’s and the member states’ cyber security practices.
Despite an incident’s or a crisis’ negative consequences,
there is always also something to learn from them.
3.2. Deadlines
There are strict deadlines for incidents that are manda-
tory to report. When comparing the CRA’s Article 14
and the NIS2 directive’s Article 23, the wordings about
the deadlines are not verbatim similar but their meaning
is more or less the same. For this reason, the deadlines
can be summarized in the form of Fig. 4. As was noted
in the preceding Subsection 3.1.5, the deadlines for report-
ing about large-scale incidents are implicit but follow from
their inevitable connection to significant incidents. An-
other clarifying remark needed is that the CRA’s notion
about actively exploited vulnerabilities is not about inci-
dents per se but can be discussed alongside them because
the reporting deadlines are similar.

Figure 4: Reporting Deadlines for Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities
and Severe, Significant, and, by implication, Large-Scale Incidents
Thus, severe, significant, and large-scale incidents
should be initially reported to an authoritative CSIRT,
or some other competent authority, no later than twenty-
four hours after becoming aware of them. Then, a more
detailed incident report should be delivered no later thanseventy-two hours after becoming aware of a given inci-
dent. The report delivered should include an initial as-
sessment about a given incident, including its severity and
impact, as well as, where applicable, any indicators of a
compromise. After these two reports, an authoritative
CSIRT may request status updates at any time. A final
report should be delivered within a month. In addition
to severity and impact, the final report should contain a
root cause analysis, any applied and ongoing mitigation
measures, and, where applicable, an assessment about any
cross-border impacts. The cross-border impact assessment
again signifies the relation to large-scale incidents. Re-
garding actively exploited vulnerabilities, the CRA’s Arti-
cle 14(2)(c) specifies that a final report should be delivered
already no later than fourteen days. It should describe
a given vulnerability’s severity and impact, information
about potential exploitation, and details about security
updates or other corrective measures made available.
Finally, it should be emphasized that while these re-
porting obligations and their deadlines are only toward
public authorities, also other parties typically need to be
informed, including further external parties, such as stake-
holders and business partners, and internal parties, such as
an organization’s management and, where applicable, its
employees (Kulikova et al., 2012). Thus, existing incident
management plans at the organizational level presumably
require or benefit from updating; a synchronization with
the law-imposed obligations might be a good idea. Due to
the various reporting obligations and strict deadlines, an
analogous point applies on the public sector side; so-called
incident triaging (ENISA, 2010) likely requires planning.
4. Crisis Management
4.1. Governance Units
The management of cyber security crises is generally
challenging in the EU due to the involvement of at least
two member states, given the definition for a large-scale
cyber security incident noted in Subsection 3.1.5. Given
the analytical levels discussed in Subsection 2.3, the man-
agement is about the national level and the supranational
level. In terms of the former, the term transnational could
be used to characterize the horizontal interstate manage-
ment and coordination between the member states in-
volved. While governments may be involved too in a case
of particularly severe crises, the term intergovernmental
might be too strong or even misleading because the ac-
tual day-to-day crisis management would not likely involve
governmental representatives in most cases. The NIS2 di-
rective also established new crisis management bodies that
are not explicitly and directly about the member states’
central governments. These also coordinate vertically to-
ward units operating at the supranational level.
In general, the NIS2 directive specifies cyber security cri-
sis management to occur through three governance bodies:
8
1. The first is the authoritative network of European
CSIRTs upon with the EU’s whole cyber security
framework was initially built (Ruohonen et al., 2016).
As the CSIRT network extends beyond Europe, the
international level may be involved too, as also in-
dicated by Fig. 2. In general, NIS2 strengthens the
European CSIRT network further, obliging also the
authoritative CSIRTs to carry out further tasks.
2. The second is a specific NIS2 cooperation group.
However, as specified in the NIS2’s Article 14(4), its
tasks are largely on the political side instead of the
operational crisis management side. Among other
things, the group is specified to help at formulating
further policies, exchanging best practices and view-
points, including regarding sectoral implementations,
carrying out risk analyses, providing strategic guid-
ance, and meeting with private sector stakeholders.
3. The third is a new European cyber crisis liaison or-
ganisation network (EU-CyCLONe). As specified in
the NIS2’s Article 16, unlike the cooperation group,
EU-CyCLONe is on the operational side; in partic-
ular, it is explicitly tasked to manage large-scale cy-
ber security incidents. In general, the management
involves similar phases that were noted in Subsec-
tion 2.4, among them preparedness and response. The
EU-CyCLONe network is specified to also coordinate
with the network of authoritative European CSIRTs.
The political side of crisis management deserves a fur-
ther comment. This side is seen in the composition of the
NIS2 cooperation group. As specified in the NIS2’s Arti-
cle 14(3), it is composed of representatives of the member
states, the EC, and ENISA, but also other public sector au-
thorities may be present, including the European External
Action Service (EEAS) who is responsible for the EU’s for-
eign policy. While the activities of the EEAS were framed
to outside of the paper’s scope via the discussion in Sub-
section 2.1, it is still worth emphasizing that cyber security
crisis management in the EU may involve also diplomacy
and related foreign policy activities, as also indicated by
the summary in Fig. 2. Analogously, the NIS2 directive’s
Article 16(3)(d) specifies that the EU-CyCLONe network
should also “support decision-making at political level”.
Given these elaborations, it is understandable that some
criticism has been levied about increased administrative
complexity, fragmentation, and bureaucratization of the
EU’s cyber security governance model in general (Ruoho-
nen, 2024a,b). Such criticism aligns with a broader branch
of research on the “bureau-politics” of crisis management
(Rosenthal et al., 1991), including potential “turf wars”
between governance bodies (Finke, 2020; Senninger et al.,
2021). This research branch is relevant to note because
rapid responses and timeliness in general are important
particularly in the cyber security context. As already the
deadlines in Fig. 4 demonstrate, rapid responses are re-
quired from EAIEs and others, but it remains generallyunclear how fast and well the responses travel through the
bureaucracy and politics at the receiving end.
4.2. Management at the Supranational Level
The CSIRT and EU-CyCLONe networks as well as the
NIS2 cooperation group operate both at the national level
and the supranational level. At the former level, these al-
low horizontal coordination between the member states;
at the latter level, these enable the member states to co-
ordinate with EU-level institutions, among them the EC
and ENISA. As was noted in Subsection 2.3.2, the Council
is on the side of intergovernmental governance, and within
the Council, the member states have permanent represen-
tatives through the Committee of the Permanent Repre-
sentatives of the Governments of the Member States to the
European Union—or Coreper in short. With these clarifi-
cations, a high-level crisis management framework at the
EU-level can be illustrated in the form of Fig. 5.
The process starts when an early warning or a later in-
cident notification is received, possibly from an EAIE or
a larger set of EAIEs, through an authoritative CSIRT or
multiple authoritative CSIRTs. For the present purposes,
the phase after the initial assessment, the EU activation
phase, is the crucial one; during this phase, the two part
definition for a large-scale cyber security incident should
be likely assessed. Politically, the activation is done by
the rotating Presidency of the Council after consulting
the EC and the EEAS’ high representative (EU, 2018).
As noted in the CSOA’s Article 20, the political activa-
tion procedure is similar to requesting help from the new
cyber reserve as well as those used for natural and other
disasters requiring civil protection. Technically, however,
the available documentation is unclear about the actual
incident analysis. The EEAS, EC, ENISA, CSIRT and
EU-CyCLONe networks are mentioned alongside Europol,
the EU’s own CSIRT (known as CERT-EU), and even the
EU’s intelligence and satellite institutions (EC, 2025a; EU,
2017). Given that the political activation depends on, or
should depend on, the adequacy and correctness of a tech-
nical incident analysis, already the amount of potential ac-
tors is enough to reiterate the earlier point about adminis-
trative complexity and its possible consequences. Nor is it
possible to deduce what might be a cost of a false positive.
Assuming that political activation is done, a further bot-
tleneck might be the subsequent phases. As seen from
Fig. 5, there are preparations and meetings before the ac-
tual EU-level coordination starts looping. If a response
time is short, these phases may cause undesirable delays.
In addition to a technical response, including the con-
tainment, eradication, and recovery tasks in the NIST’s
framework (Cichonski et al., 2012), the EU’s crisis man-
agement plans include also considerations about funding
needs, diplomatic responses, and crisis communication.
In addition to academic research (Kulikova et al., 2012),
the role and importance of crisis communication have re-
cently been emphasized also by ENISA (2024) who further

5. Discussion
5.1. Conclusion
The paper’s conclusion can be summarized by answering
to the three RQs specified in the introduction. Thus:
1. The EU’s new cyber security laws distinguish four
incident types: “conventional” incidents, severe inci-
dents, significant incidents, and large-scale incidents.
Albeit only implicitly, the last incident type is equated
to the concept of a cyber security crisis. The definition
for such a crisis is twofold: a cyber security incident
becomes a cyber security crisis either in case it ex-
ceeds a handling capacity of a single member state of
the EU or in case it significantly affects at least two
member states simultaneously.
2. The EU’s new cyber security laws significantly extend
reporting obligations toward public sector authorities.
Both operators of critical infrastructures and produc-
ers of many information technology products are man-
dated to report incidents; only reporting of the “con-
ventional” incidents is voluntary. The deadlines for
reporting are also strict.
3. Cyber security crisis management and its governance
in the EU are still strongly built upon national au-
thoritative CSIRTs and their EU-level coordination
bodies, including ENISA in particular. However, the
new laws have also brought additional governance
bodies, among them EU-CyCLONe that was specif-
ically established for cyber security crisis manage-
ment. In addition, a new staff reserve has been es-
tablished for helping countries facing cyber security
crises. Despite—or due to—these new crisis manage-
ment bodies and recent policy proposals, it remains
generally unclear how—and how well—crisis manage-
ment works at the EU-level administration.5.2. Further Work
The three concluding answers can be accompanied by
three points about further research. To motivate the first
point, it can be noted that despite uncertainties about
actual crisis management particularly at the EU-level, it
seems the NIS2 directive has addressed a commonplace
problem among many member states whose national laws
and frameworks lacked a definition for a cyber security cri-
sis (Boin et al., 2018). However, the NIS2’s definition for
a large-scale cyber security incident might also be argued
to be about too large crises in a sense that an escalation
to a national level might already be perceived as a crisis in
some severe cases. Given the overall escalation theme in
incident management research (Mitropoulos et al., 2006),
(1) further theoretical and comparative research is needed
about the analytical levels in Fig. 1. Regarding compar-
isons, a good starting point would be a comparative exam-
ination of national laws and frameworks for cyber security
crisis management in the member states. Despite the new
EU laws, national and other definitions for alert levels and
criticality itself remain unclear, non-harmonized, and gen-
erally vague (Alexopoulos et al., 2025; Ruohonen, 2024a).
Also the paper’s framings noted in Subsection 2.1 would
deserve a theoretical visit. Despite the research on hy-
brid threats, the relation between cyber security incidents
and crises, including their potential cascading effects, and
other incidents and crises remain arguably poorly under-
stood and theorized. These points justify the need for
more theoretical and conceptual research.
Regarding the EU-level cyber security crisis manage-
ment, (2) further research is required also on the roles,
duties, and other functions of various different administra-
tive units, whether national, supranational, or something
in-between. Composites such accountability, collaboration
and coordination, transparency, information sharing, de-
centralization and autonomy, and responsiveness could be
used to frame an evaluation (cf. Vu et al., 2025). How-
ever: even though it is easy to agree with an argument
that more empirical research is needed on incident man-
agement in general (Tøndel et al., 2014), a problem with
the NIS2’s large-scale incidents is that thus far at least
10
publicly disclosed cases are missing. In other words, it is
difficult to properly evaluate a management of something
that has not supposedly yet happened in Europe.
Therefore, regarding empirical research, it might make
sense to start from smaller evaluations. In particular,
(3) the increased reporting obligations, including the strict
deadlines, would offer a good topic for empirical evalu-
ation research. A lot of research and other work have
also been done to help at evaluating the efficiency, accu-
racy, and other aspects CSIRTs and their incident manage-
ment practices (Connell and Waits, 2013; Dorofee et al.,
2007, among many others). However, a broader evalu-
ation is required also with respect to EAIEs and others
who are obliged to report about incidents or do so volun-
tarily. Given the CRA’s and NIS2’s strict deadlines, as
well as the penalties from non-compliance, it may be that
organizations and others will report eagerly and possibly
incautiously. Thus, the quality of early warnings, inci-
dents notifications, and particularly final reports (Busetti
and Scanni, 2025), including a rate of false positives, would
provide a good research topic with practical relevance. A
related topic would involve examining whether reporting
guidelines and a systematic reporting format might in-
crease reporting quality and reduce noise. As it stands,
neither the NIS2 directive nor the other laws say anything
about what should be reported. The topic is generally im-
portant because regulatory obligations upon incident man-
agement have recently been argued to work poorly in im-
proving organizations’ cyber security postures (Patterson
et al., 2024). This point serves well to end the paper by
reiterating that something should always be learned from
cyber security incidents and crises.

1 Introduction
The internet has become a fundamental part of the modern society, tremendous amount of
valuable data and money are transferred through the internet, and cyber security is even more
important today than ever. To combat cyber threats, one of the emerging new methodology
is cyber threat hunting. Cyber Threat hunting is a proactive cyber defence activity. Instead
of waiting for the cyber threat to compromise the system, the cyber security personnel will
proactively hunt for the potential cyber threat. Although cyber threat hunting is practiced in
many companies, these companies are not yet satised with the eectiveness of cyber threat
hunting.
For cyber threat hunting, the most commonly known categories are: First, the data-driven
hunting, which is triggered by data observation [1][MJ18]; Second, the Intel-driven hunting,
identies threat intelligence information [2][Gao+20]; Third, the techniques, tactics, and proce-
dures, (TTP) driven hunting, searching for threat tactics, techniques and procedures.[3] [Ber+21]
Cyber threat huntingis used as baseline for next generation security operation center. [4][Bik+21]
Cyber threat hunting has also been used in industrial control systems. [5] [JL21][6][MG22]
1.1 Prior Research
In recent papers, we can see some new methods used for cyber threat hunting. There is a study
on evidence based classication method for cyber threat hunting by Matthew Beechey team.
[7][BKL21]
In the study of another team, Fengyu Yang team [8][Yan+22], cyber threat hunting is more
exible becuase their study is somewhat a hybrid cyber threat hunting.
The study of Abbas Yazdinejad team in 2022 [9][Yaz+22a], where a deep learning model is
used for cyber threat hunting in industrial internet. As we have seen in the paragraph above,
industrial internet is a major part of the cyber threat hunting.
In the 2021 paper by Renzheng Wei team, we see them using the method of neural network for
cyber threat hunting.[10][Wei+21]
Similarly, in the 2022 paper by Chung-Kuan Chen team, they inplement machine learning as a
way for cyber threat hunting.[11][Che+22]
1.2 Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to study existing studies of cyber threat hunting, and our goal
is to anaylyze these studies and nd the modern trend for cyber threat hunting. To better
illustrate this research, see Table 1.
1.3 Contribution and Layout
•This research is complementary to existing cyber hunting researches, and is meant to
provide some insights for other researchers looking into literature study of cyber threat
hunting.
•We identify 95 papers related to the study of cyber threat hunting, with the latest in year
2022.
•Then from these papers, we selected 25 essential papers for further in depth study, because
they meet with the keywords we set for these papers. And thus these papers can provide
essential; information in our comparative study.
3
•We will conduct a study of the data in these 25 papers.
•And we will provide a meta-analysis of the methods introduced in these papers.
In this research, we make presentations and provide a possible trend for future cyber hunting
studies.
Table 1: Research Questions
Research Questions Discussion
What are the latest cyber threat hunting methods? In this research, we
have observed data-
driven, Intel-driven
and TTP-driven.
How is cyber threat hunting used to improve cyber security? In this research, we
believe cyber threat
hunting can create se-
curity for industrial
networks, and possi-
bly provide a higher
level of security to
other elds.
What new methods are available for cyber threat hunting? In this research, we
have observed deep
learning, machine
learning and neural
network used for
cyber threat hunting.

2 Research Methodology
To achieve answer the research questions, we conduct the SLR. In this section, we discuss
the planning, conducting and reporting of the review in iterations to allow for a thorough
understanding of this SLR.
2.1 Selection of Primary Studies
The selection process involves using dierent searching strings in the dierent database plat-
forms. In our study, we used search string as ""cyber threat"", ""threat hunting"", ""data-driven"".
The platforms searched were:
- IEEE Xplore Digital Library
- ScienceDirect
- SpringerLink
- ACM Digital Library
- Google Scholar
The searches were run against the title of Cyber Threat Hunting, keywords or abstract, de-
pending on dierent databases. All these searches were conducted on 15th October 2022, and
we processed all recent studies in the databases that were published before this date. Then we
lter all the papers we found in these databases through our inclusion/exclusion criterias.
2.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Studies to be included in this SLR must report empirical methodology of cyber-threat hunting
and could be papers on case studies, new technology and commentaries on the development
of existing Cyber-threat hunting methods such as data-driven or Intel-driven. They must be
peer-reviewed and written in English.
Table 2: Inclusion and Exclusion criteria
Inclusion Exclusion
Paper shows empirical use of method. Paper focuses on cy-
ber threat.
Paper contains information of threat hunting. Data log of informa-
tion
Paper is written in English. Paper not in English.
2.3 Selection Results
There were a total of 937 studies identied from the initial keyword searches on the selected
platforms. Then we excluded the ones that do not meet our need for this research. We get a
total of 30 papers. After which we selected 25 from the 30 viable papers.
2.4 Quality Assessment
An assessment of the quality of primary studies was made according to the guidance.
Stage 1: Cyber Threat hunting, the paper must be on the subject of threat hunting or empha-
sizing a method for threat hunting.
Stage 2: Context, how the cyber threat hunting method is utilized in this paper.
Stage 3: Method Application, if this method is one of the new methods or the traditional.

Table 3: Excluded Papers
Checklist for Stages Excluded Studies
Stage 1 Cyber Threat Hunting [26][Wan+22]
Stage 2 Context [27][Yaz+22b]
Stage 3 Method Application [28][Rad+21]
Stage 4 Threat type [29][Mav+21]
Stage 5 Data reliability [30][Tro20]
Stage 4: Threat type, if this paper provides enough information about the cyber threat.
Stage 5: Data reliability, if the data is reliable
In this way, we can make sure this research is more eective and all the data that we extract
from the papers are reliable enough for further analysis.
2.5 Data Extraction
All the papers in the reference have now passed the quality assessment, so now we extract all
their study data from their papers, and we can divide the study data into these categories.
Context data: Information about the purpose of the study.
Qualitative data: Findings and conclusions provided by the authors.
Quantitative data: When applied to the study, data observed by experimentation and research.
2.6 Data Analysis
To meet the objective of answering the research questions, we compiled the data held within the
qualitative and quantitative data categories. And we conducted a meta-analysis of the papers.
Figure 1: Paper Through Processing

2.6.1 Publication over time
The numbers of publication is increasing over the years. There was only 3 during 2018-2019.
Another 5 during 2019-2020 and 7 during 2020-2021. And There were 10 between 2021-2022.
So we can envision there to be way more study in this area.

2.6.2 Signicant Keyword Count
In order to summarize all these papers, we decide to conduct a keyword search to nd the most
common themes among these papers. And obviously, Cyber threat and threat hunting were the
top of the table.

3 Findings
Each primary research paper was read in full and relevant qualitative and quantitative data was
extracted and summarized in [Table 5-13]. All primary studies focuses on the application and
dierent methods of cyber threat hunting. The focus of all papers is recorded below in [Table
5-13].
Each paper's theme and focus was further grouped into ve primary categories, Machine Learn-
ing, TTP, Data, Intel and Neural Network.
Studies that had a focus concerning deep learning, grouped together into the machine learning
category.
Figure 3 shows the percentages of dierent themes of the 25 primary studies, all of these have
passed the quality assessment to be included in the data analysis. The Most common themes
identied in the primary studies are the studies of Machine Learning at 29 percent in the ap-
plication of Cyber Threat Hunting, and in most of these cases, the use of Deep Learning is the
focus. Tied in the rst place,the other most common theme of the studies is TTP, the analyses
of tactic , technique and procedure at 29 percent. Data is the third commonest theme at 17
percent, these are the most traditional studies of the cyber threat hunting. And one of these
studies is the hybrid study of combining data-driven with other focus dierent studies. Neural
Network and Intel-driven are tied as the fourth most common focus in these papers at 13 per-
cent. In a sense it is similar to Machine Learning but the focus is dierent.

4 Discussion
The initial research into Cyber Threat Hunting yields more insights into the general consensus
on the subject. A deeper look into the studies show that one of the major issues many cases
of cyber threat hunting has shown is the lack of eciency as such a hunting process is time
consuming and required human eort.
However, with recent developments in articial intelligence and potentially more open data bases
on these subjects, machine learning, deep learning and neural networking is becoming one of
the most common theme in these recent papers. As we can see in Figure 2 and Table 5-13,
the number of papers related to cyber threat hunting and machine learning is slowly but surely
increasing.
The researchers of these papers used established open source platforms, such as the open-source
Cyber Threat Intelligence (OSCTI) such as Case [2][Gao+20] and Case [20][Gao+21]. There
are several reasons for researcher to use such platforms. The OSCTI is about sharing intel on
cyber threats, therefore for the studies that focuses on intel-driven study, these open source
platform is most useful. Machine learning can also use open source platforms as we can see in
Case [19][Ara+22].
Deep learning and Machine Learning are used to create models for threat hunting, as we can
see in Case [6][MG22], Case [9][Yaz+22a],Case [11][Che+22]. The other papers build a machine
learning algorithm for decision making, in order to maximize the eciency of cyber threat hunt-
ing, as we can see in Case [13][KMV17], Case [22][HF20], and Case [21][RYP21], which also
leaned towards neural networking.
4.1 RQ1: What are the latest cyber threat hunting methods?
The latest cyber threat hunting methods are the uses of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and
Neural Networks. As we can see in Figure 3, and we can see a lot more about the latest cyber
threat hunting methods from Table 5-13.
Most recent methods includes Neural Networking such as Case [10][Wei+21] and Case[21][RYP21].
The far more popular new method is machine learning.
4.2 RQ2: How is cyber threat hunting used to improve cyber security?
In many ways, TTP is the best to explain why cyber threat hunting is used to improve cyber
security.
1, Blind spots in public data sources, as seen in Case[17].
2, Hypothesis of future cyber threat, as stated in Case[5], Case[12][Ajm+21], with TTP-driven
cyber threat hunting, the security can predict and prepare for potential threat before the system
is under attck.
4.3 RQ3: What new methods are available for cyber threat hunting?
According to the primary studies, we can see a rising trend of using hybrid types of cyber threat
hunting, by combining machine learning with TTP, the system will be more capable of predict-
ing how the cyber threat will attack.
The latest studies suggested that the most commonly accepted applications for machine learn-
ing/neural networking were as follow:
1, Machine Learning algorithm for Decision Making in the neural networking. As seen in Case
[6][MG22] , Case [11][Che+22] , Case[13][KMV17] and Case [21][RYP21] and [22][HF20].
2, Machine Learning analyzer, AS in Case [19][Ara+22].
3, Threat hunting model based on Machine Learning. Commonly seen in machine learning cases
such as Case [6][MG22], Case [9][Yaz+22a],Case [11][Che+22]

5 Future Research Directions of Cyber Threat Hunting
Based on the results of this literature analysis and our observations, we present the following
research directions that are worth further investigations.
Deep Learning and TTP
The hybrid study of TTP and Deep Learning, where the system will learn from Open Sources
Cyber Threats and project the future TTP for cyber threat hunting.
Neural Network
The neural network, which is linked commonly to the crafting of a machine learning algorithm
in order to create the clear decision making pathway for the neural networking system. Further
study could prove more ecient bsed on past ML models as seen in Case [21], Case [22].
Industrial ML
Machine Learning combined with industrial cyber security. This is a potential projection be-
cause most commonly known industrial cyber threat hunting are still based on classier which
s data-driven or TTP-driven as in Case [5]. By combining the machine learning methodology
into classier for industrial cyber threat hunting could greatly improve their eciency.

Abstract —This paper concerns the security of the electric power
transmission grid facing the threat of malicious cyber-physical
attackers. We posit that there is no such thing as perfectly ef-
fective cyber-security. Rather, any cyber-security measure comes
with the possibility that a highly skilled attacker could (eventually
find a way to) bypass it. On these grounds, we formulate a tri-
level decision making problem seeking to co-optimize preventive
physical and cyber-security measures under uncertainty on the
ability of an exogenous cyber-physical attacker to overcome
the latter. Preventive physical security measures refer to the
ex-ante procurement of reserve capacity, which translates into
ramping restrictions in real-time. Cyber-security measures refer
to updating the firewall rules so as to impede an intruder from
taking over the cyber infrastructure of the grid and disconnecting
power generators and transmission branches. We adopt standard
assumptions to formalize the inner optimization problems corre-
sponding to the cyber-physical attacker and power grid operator
and focus on uncertainty management at the uppermost level
of the problem. Our findings establish that physical- and cyber-
security measures are non-exchangeable complements in keeping
the power grid operation secure.
Index Terms —cyber-physical systems, electric power system risk
management.

Introduction
Advanced digital technology is vital for the functioning of
today’s electric power system. Indeed, the modern power grid
relies on its cyber sub-system for most monitoring, protection,
control and optimization functionalities and operates as a com-
plex cyber-physical system. This essential technology however
may also pose a severe vulnerability. The risk that a malicious
adversary may intentionally exploit the power grid’s cyber sub-
system so as to disrupt electricity supply has unfortunately
been validated in practice [1]. As a result electric power system
cyber-security is nowadays recognized as critical and there is
a growing development of standards, rules and regulations [2].
Related literature
The question of securing the grid operation while facing
the threat of an intelligent cyber-physical attacker is actively
pursued by the research community. Most research works rely
on multi-level optimization to explicitly model the interrelated
decisions of malicious cyber-physical attackers and power
grid so-called “defenders” ( i.e., planners and operators) [3].
Bi-level optimization problems are cast from the perspective
of a cyber-physical attacker seeking to optimize her attack
vector while explicitly accounting for the optimal reaction
of the power grid operator. Such models can be used in an
assessment context, so as to identify which vulnerabilities a
cyber-physical attacker could target to exploit. Tri-level prob-
lems are cast from the (preceding) perspective of a preventive
planner. The goal here is to identify preventive measures
to counteract a cyber-physical attacker’s optimal strategy, in
turn maximizing her own objective while anticipating the
grid operator’s reaction. He et al. [4] consider the problem
of facing a cyber-physical attacker capable of both injecting
false data and physically disconnecting transmission lines. An
innovative feature of this work is the allocation of Distributed
Generators (DGs) in the post-attack stage, translating mathe-
matically into binary variables at the lowest-level optimization
problem modeling power system operation. The considered
preventive measures only act on the physical infrastructure of
the grid by hardening transmission components. In contrast,
Lai et al. [5] focus on choosing cyber-security preventive
measures only. These authors address the problem of placing
firewalls so as to block unauthorized access to protection
relays that could be exploited by a cyber-physical attacker
seeking to cause a cascading failure. Qin et al. [6] also
consider the placement of firewalls to impede unauthorisedaccess to the grid’s relays. The novel feature of this work is the
consideration of detailed substation topologies. Both groups
of authors in [5] and [6] adopt the assumption that firewalls
are perfectly effective countermeasures, blocking any cyber-
physical attacker’s unauthorized access with certainty. While
such an assumption is quite common in the power system’s
literature, it may be regarded as questionable in the cyber-
security context. In practice, the capabilities of cyber-physical
attackers continuously evolve, cyber-security measures have
specific protection scopes, while yet undiscovered (a.k.a., zero-
day) vulnerabilities may always exist. In line with this, —hang
et al. [7] consider the problem of allocating cyber-security
devices that only reduce rather than completely eliminate the
probability of a successful cyber-physical attack against the
grid’s transmission branches.
Paper Scope & contributions
In this paper we also take the pragmatic viewpoint that cyber-
security measures should not be considered as 100% effective.
On this basis, we investigate the stakes for an integrated cyber-
physical risk management framework wherein (i) preventive
cyber-security measures are realistically considered to reduce
rather than eliminate the probability of a successful cyber-
physical attack, and (ii) the synergy with physical-security
measures is acknowledged. To do so, we formulate a tri-
level optimization problem seeking to choose in advance both
physical- and cyber-security preventive measures, subject to
uncertainty on the effectiveness of the latter. We model such
uncertainty by way of a probability distribution of exogenous
cyber-physical attackers differentiated in terms of their capa-
bility to overcome or not the cyber-security measures protect-
ing the power grid. Without loss in generality, we focus on
the particular threat posed by cyber-physical attackers seeking
to intrude into the power grid’s substations and disconnect
power generators and transmission branches ( i.e., lines and
transformers) so as to maximize operational costs, including
the cost associated to involuntary load shedding. Anticipating
such threat, a preventive planner may choose to update the
security rules of the firewalls protecting the grid’s substations
and/or to procure reserve that can be deployed in the aftermath
of a successful attack. To solve the resulting problem, under
standard assumptions, we rely on a modified version of the
classic Column & Constraint Generation (C&CG) algorithm
by [8]. Results obtained on two benchmark systems, namely
the 24-bus version of the IEEE Reliability Test System [9]
and the IEEE 118-bus system [10], showcase the complex
interrelations between physical- and cyber-security measures.
Assumptions, models & methods
Problem description
We adopt a planning perspective and consider the problem
of protecting the electric power system operation against the

threat of malicious cyber-physical attacks. Figure 1 illustrates
the independent decision-making actors involved in this prob-
lem.
The central actor is the cyber-physical attacker (a.k.a. attacker
for brevity) who may seek to compromise the functionalities of
the power grid’s cyber sub-system so as to disrupt electricity
supply. The left-most actor is the so-called cyber-physical
planner (a.k.a. planner for brevity). Anticipating the threat
posed by the cyber-physical attacker, she may act on (i) the
power grid’s cyber sub-system to ensure that it cannot be
breached in a way causing an unacceptable electricity supply
and/or (ii) the physical power grid so as to ensure that it can
maintain an acceptable electricity supply service in spite of the
maloperation of its cyber sub-system. Finally, the right-most
actor is the power grid operator (a.k.a. operator for brevity)
who, in the aftermath of any cyber-physical attack, must
operate the (possibly compromised) electric power system.
We explicitly acknowledge that cyber-security measures have
specific protection scopes and are also susceptible to unknown
vulnerabilities ( e.g., zero-day vulnerabilities), while the capa-
bilities of cyber-physical attackers are constantly evolving. In
short, with any cyber-security measure comes the risk that
a sufficiently capable cyber-physical attacker may still find
a way to compromise the protected functionality. To account
for this feature, we consider a discrete set of alternative cyber-
physical attackers differentiated in terms of available resources
(i.e., number of cyber sub-system components an attacker
can compromise) and capabilities to overcome the applicable
cyber-security measures. We further associate a probability
measure to this set so as to represent the threat landscape as a
probability distribution over credible cyber-physical attackers.
Any credible cyber-physical attacker is assumed to be an
independent decision-maker, choosing her attack vector upon
observing the active cyber- and physical- security measures
and while anticipating the optimal reaction of the power
grid operator. The corresponding decision-making problem
can be cast as a bi-level optimization problem. Similarly, the
cyber-physical planner is considered to be an independent
decision-maker choosing her risk management strategy while
anticipating the optimal reaction of each alternative cyber-
physical attacker. Under information symmetry assumptions,
the respective decision-making problem can be cast as a tri-level optimization problem under uncertainty.
We consider a set-up wherein cyber-physical attackers may
seek to intrude into digital substations1and disconnect power
generators and transmission lines so as to maximize the power
grid operational costs. These latter costs include generation
redispatching costs and costs of involuntary load shedding and
are determined as per the optimal reaction of the power grid
operator to the realized grid status. A cyber-physical attacker’s
strategy is constrained by a resource limit, specifying the num-
ber of substations she may simultaneously gain unauthorized
access into. Once infiltrating a substation, the cyber-physical
attacker can disconnect generators and transmission branches.
Anticipating this uncertain threat, a cyber-physical planner
may choose to update the rules of cyber-security devices
blocking unauthorized access (a.k.a., firewalls) to the grid’s
substations. Additionally, this actor should also choose the
system reserve capacity which constrains the redispatching of
generating units in real-time operation. The objective of the
cyber-physical planner is to jointly minimize the cost of base-
case operation ( i.e., generation dispatch) and cyber-physical
security measures ( i.e., of updating firewall rules and reserve
procurement) along with the expected cost of the power grid
operation ( i.e., expected generation redispatching and load
shedding).
Mathematical formulation
Relying on the DC power flow approximation to keep the
model of the grid physics linear, we express the trilevel
optimization problem of the cyber-physical planner as in (1
– 22).
The top row of the planner’s objective (1) includes all 1st-stage
costs, and specifically the cost of the pre-attack generation
dispatch, the cost of reserve procurement, and the cost of
mobilizing resources at the physical locations of the different
buses of the system to update the firewall rules (3rdterm).
These 1st-stage costs are to be jointly minimized along with
the expectation of the power grid operation cost over the
post-attacks states while facing the threat described as the
postulated set of cyber-physical attackers. The probability
weighted summation of these costs is as shown in the bottom
row of (1) and includes scenario-specific redispatching and
load shedding costs.
Inequality constraint (2) is a resource constraint limiting the
total number of firewalls that the cyber-physical planner can
update with new security rules in the considered lead-time.
Constraints (3,4) define the feasible region of the planner’s
generation variables, referring to the pre-attack dispatch and
1For ease of exposition, and without loss in generality, we henceforth
assume that any single bus corresponds to a distinct digital substation and
use the terms bus and substation interchangeably to describe the assumed
threat.

reserve capacity. Constraint (5) models the choice of where
to update firewall rules as a binary decision. The group of
constraints (6 – 8) enforces that the pre-attack dispatch implies
no loss of load and conforms to the branch thermal ratings as
per the DC power flow approximation. While the focus is on
the considered cyber-physical threat, this group of constraints
is included to ensure that reserve procurement is not unrealistic
with respect to the pre-attack operation of the system.
For any cyber-physical attacker i∈ A ∪ B the objective
function to be maximized is the cost of power grid opera-
tion, including attack-induced reserve deployment and load
shedding (9). Constraint (10) defines an attacker’s resources in
terms of the number of buses she may simultaneously infiltrate.
Inequality constraints (11) are only valid for so-called cyber-
physical attackers with basic capabilities and enforce that any
such actor may not infiltrate any bus that is protected by means
of updated firewall rules2. The choice to intrude into the cyber
sub-system of a specific bus is modeled through a binary
decision variable (12). Inequality constraints (13) link the sta-
tus of transmission branches and the potential intrusion of its
associated (“sending/receiving”) end-buses. Specifically, these
constraints enforce that a branch can only be disconnected
if the cyber-physical attacker has managed to successfully
intrude either its “sending” or “receiving” bus. We use binary
decision variables to model branch disconnection decisions
(14). Equality constraints (15) model the disconnection of the
generating units connected at a breached bus.
Expressions (16 – 22) model the operator’s reaction to the
realized attack and, under information symmetry assumptions,
the impact of the attack on the power grid operation cost.
Constraints (17,18) limit the reserve energy to be used by
the operator according to the capacity procured by the cyber-
physical planner and, of course, the connection status of the
respective unit. Equality constraints (19) express the nodal
power balance for the post-attack system state, featuring the
additional decision variables corresponding to the deployment
of reserve energy and the use of involuntary load shedding.
Notice here the product of the pre-attack dispatch decided
by the planner and the attacker’s decision to compromise the
concerned bus. In (20), the non-negative load shedding vari-
able is upper bounded by the respective nodal load demand.
Equality constraints (21) define the post-attack power flow
as the product of the branch disconnection variable and the
fraction of the voltage angle difference divided by the branch
reactance. Finally, inequalities (22) impose the branch thermal

Algorithmic solution approach
We rely on a modified version of the Column & Constraint
Generation (C&CG) by [8] to solve tri-level optimization
problem (1 – 22). To the best of our knowledge, [11] first
applied the C&CG algorithm in the context of electric power
systems security management to solve the deterministic opti-
mization problem of choosing which transmission branches
to protect facing an attacker with the ability to physically
disconnect transmission branches. [12] used a modified version
of this algorithm in a stochastic setting, considering the
resources of the attacker as uncertain.
In order to briefly explain the C&CG algorithm, let us first
notice that constraints (10,12 – 15) implicitly form a finite
attack surface consisting of distinct attack vector scenarios
(i.e., substations to intrude and associated branches & gener-
ators to disconnect) per cyber-physical attacker i∈ A ∪ B .
We will henceforth denote the attack surface for any single
cyber-physical attacker as Si. In problem (9 –22), any cyber-
physical attacker essentially chooses the attack vector with the
maximal impact on the power grid operation cost out of her
corresponding finite set Si. This choice of course depends on
the cyber-physical planner’s decisions protecting the power
grid operation. These latter decisions in turn depend on the
attack vectors that the cyber-physical planner anticipates the
alternative attackers to potentially launch. The idea then is to
iteratively update the planner’s decisions while generating for
each alternative cyber-physical attacker ia growing sequence
Sk
iof subsets containing maximal-impact scenarios chosen
from the attack vectors Sithat can be launched by this attacker.
In other words, explicitly form finite subsets of attack vector
scenarios that would allow the planner to make “similar”
Fig. 2. Column & constraint generation flowchart
decisions as the decisions that would be made while facing
the complete attack surface ∪i∈A∪BSi. By way of “similar”
decisions, we refer here to near-optimal decisions that imply
practically equal total costs ( i.e., base case dispatch costs,
reserve procurement costs and expected impact of the cyber-
physical attack on the power grid operation).
Figure 2 presents the flowchart of the implemented CC&G
algorithm. In every iteration k, given the current finite subsets
Sk
i, aSingle-level Master Problem is solved to update the
decisions of the cyber-physical planner regarding the updating
of firewall rules ( zk) as well as the dispatch and reserve
capacity of generating units ( pk,rk). The solution of this
problem also provides an updated lower bound for the total
cost which is optimized while taking into consideration subsets
Sk
i. Given the updated decisions of the cyber-physical planner
(zk,pk,rk), we then solve a Bi-level Sub-Problem per cyber-
physical attacker i∈ A ∪ B to update her attack vector
(vk
i,wk
i,yk
i). Along with the updated attack vectors, the res-
olution of all bi-level problems also allows to compute an up-
dated estimation for the 2ndstage costs expressing the expected
impact of the potential attacks. We add this updated estimation
to the cost of the updated 1ststage decisions ( zk,pk,rk) to
update an upper bound for the total cost. While the difference
between the upper and lower bounds is not within the specified
tolerance, the attack surface of any alternative cyber-physical
attacker is updated as in Sk+1
i← Sk
i∪ {(vk
i,wk
i,yk
i)}.
Single-level Master Problem: vs a given attack surface
At every iteration of the algorithm, and given an updated attack
surface ∪i∈A∪BSk
i, we formulate a single-level scenario sub-
problem that corresponds to tri-level problem (1 – 22). To do
so, we first introduce attack-vector-specific 2ndstage variables

Constraints (10 – 12, 15, 17 –20,22) can be directly re-
written per cyber-physical attacker and attack vector. Further,
the operator’s objective function (16) can be omitted since this
actor and the cyber-physical planner are cooperating towards
the same interest. The only noteworthy aspect is the treatment
of transmission branch constraints (13,14) along with (21).
We recall here that (13,14) allow a cyber-physical attacker
to disconnect a transmission branch provided that she has
intruded into a substation including any one of its end-buses. In
the single-level reformulation, and while considering the finite
attack vector scenario subsets ∪i∈A∪BSk
i, we must enforce
that any transmission branch under attack will be disconnected
if any one of its end-buses is attacked and not successfully
protected (either by relying on outdated firewall rules or by
facing an attacker that can by-pass the updated rules). To do
so, we use the following expressions:

straints (23 – 26) set the power flow through a branch to
zero if at least one of its end-buses is successfully attacked.
Inequalities (27 – 28) enforce the power flow definition from
equality (21) only for branches whose end-buses are both
protected successfully. Equality constraint (29) only holds
for the sub-class of cyber-physical attackers with advanced
capabilities. Since these actors can by-pass the cyber-security
measures, the power flow of any attacked branch will in any
case be equal to zero. Finally, the standard DC power flow
definition equality is imposed for any transmission branch that
is not under attack (30).
Bi-level Sub-Problems: vs a given cyber-physical security plan
At every iteration of the algorithm, and given updated deci-
sions for the cyber-physical planner ( zk,pk,rk), we formulate
per cyber-physical attacker i∈ A ∪ B a bi-level problem as
in (9 – 22). To solve these problems we rely on the fact
that the lowest-level minimization problem (16 – 22) is a
convex optimization problem. Exploiting this property, we
remove the minimization operator of (16), introduce the dual
feasibility constraints of (16 – 22) and enforce the strong
duality condition [13].
Results
We consider a set of case studies defined on two well known
benchmarks, namely the IEEE 24-bus and 118-bus systems.
Figures 3 and 4 plot the respective single-line diagrams.
Our motivation for using two different benchmarks is to
derive observations that do not depend on the properties of
the considered system. We use all original system data as
documented by [10] and supplement these with:
1) An assumed value of lost load parameter, set at 5000
monetary units per MWh;
2) an assumed cost of updating firewall rules parameter, set
at 5.55 monetary units per device;
3) An assumed reserve capacity cost parameter, set per
generator at 25% of the respective dispatch cost param-
eter.
To put results into context, we will henceforth report all cost
data in percentage of the base-case dispatch cost of the re-
spective benchmark. Such cost is computed while considering
an empty set of potential cyber-physical attackers and solving
optimization problem (1 – 8). It amounts to 41904.11 monetary
units for the IEEE 24-bus benchmark and 109826.08 monetary
units for the IEEE 118-bus benchmark. Table I collects the test
cases considered and introduces the order in which results will
be presented. As can be seen, apart from different benchmark
systems, we differentiate test cases in terms of the cyber-
security resources available to the planner (3rdcolumn), the

Fig. 4. Single-line diagram of the IEEE 118-bus benchmark [15]Unlimited cyber-security resources
We start by considering a set of test-cases on the 24-bus system
and while assuming that the cyber-physical planner has unlim-
ited cyber-security resources that would allow her to update
the firewalls rules for all buses of the system. We first consider
in case A that there exists only a single credible cyber-physical
attacker and this actor does not have the capability to overcome
the applicable cyber-security measures. In complementary case
B we consider that the same cyber-physical attacker can by-
pass firewalls, even under the updated rules. In both cases, the
probability associated to the single credible attacker is set at
0.01 and her resource limit is set to 2, meaning that she has
the ability to intrude at most 2 buses. Table II includes the
results for these two test cases.

SOLUTION OVERVIEW FOR TEST CASES A – C
Starting from the data in the top row of Table II, if cyber-
security measures are fully effective, in the assumed conditions
it makes (economic) sense to fully rely on these so as to
completely neutralize the threat posed by the cyber-physical
attacker. Indeed, the optimal strategy here is to pay a negligible
additional cost of 0.29% at the planning stage so as to ensure
that a potential cyber-physical attack may not have any impact
on the power grid operation. Notice that this additional 0.29%
is only spent on updating the firewall rules, since the optimal
costs of generation dispatch and reserve procurement are
identical to the aforementioned base-case results (computed
while assuming no credible threat). It should also be noted
that the optimal planning strategy is to deploy the considered
cyber-security measure in 22 out of the 24 system buses.
Recalling here that the 24-bus benchmark is relatively lightly
loaded and has ample transmission capacity, in the considered
steady-state, linear model it could withstand the outage of two
transmission ( i.e., no load or generation) buses.
The middle row of Table II concerns the case wherein the
cyber-physical attacker would have the advanced capability
to by-pass the cyber-security measures under consideration. It
is easy to understand that, facing only such a threat actor,
there is no point in using cyber-security measures. Rather,
the only form of security can come from physical measures.
In the assumed conditions, it makes (economic) sense to
spend an additional cost of 17.17% in choosing the generation
dispatch and procuring reserve capacity. Still, this would
not completely neutralize the credible threat which carries a
substantial expected impact. It would be equal to 83.37% of
the base-case dispatch cost. Our detailed results indicate that
Bulk Power System Dynamics and Control - XII, June 2025, Sorrento, Italy
the cyber-physical attacker’s strategy would be to intrude buses
15 (load and significant generation capacity) and 23 (largest
generation capacity) thus provoking both reserve deployment
and involuntary load shedding.
Let us now move on to test case C, which as seen in Table
I concerns two alternative credible cyber-physical attackers
differentiated only in terms of their ability to overcome or
not the updated firewall rules. Both these actors have the
same resources as in cases A and B and share equally the
total probability associated to the attackers in cases A or B.
The bottom row of Table II reports the corresponding solution
overview. As evidenced by these results, acknowledging that a
cyber-physical attacker may not be impeded by cyber-security
measures results in using a blend of cyber- and physical-
security measures. Indeed, the optimal solution includes both
updating the firewall rules for 21 system buses and paying an
additional 7.2% in generation dispatch and reserve capacity.
What is most interesting here is the synergy between the
latter and former measures. The physical system is more
strongly prepared, by way of the generation dispatch and
reserve capacity, since possibly facing an attacker that could
by-pass cyber-security measures. This strength also carries
over to possibly facing the alternative attacker that would not
be able to by-pass the firewall rules. The available reserve
capacity, along with the reduced probability of the cyber-
physical attacker with basic capabilities, imply that she is
expected to only cause a minor impact on the power grid
operation. As a result, the security of the cyber sub-system
against this threat can be slightly relaxed. Compared to case
A, one less bus is chosen to be protected by cyber-security
measures in case C.
Limited cyber-security resources
We continue with a set of test-cases on the 24-bus and 118-
bus benchmarks in the setting where the cyber-security re-
sources of the planner are limited. We believe that considering
such limitation is very relevant, since in practice deploying
cyber-security measures may involve mobilizing specialized
workforce to access the concerned systems locally. For both
benchmarks, we limit the cyber-physical planner’s resources
to 3 while maintaining the assumption that any attacker could
at most intrude into 2 buses. We form alternative test cases
by varying the sets of credible cyber-physical attackers in the
same style as previously. Specifically, for any benchmark, we
consider the alternative hypotheses of facing (i,ii) a single
credible attacker with either basic or advanced capabilities as
well as (iii) two credible attackers with basic and advanced
capabilities respectively.

indeed restrictive. This restriction is partly counterbalanced
by the procurement of reserve capacity at an additional cost
of 17.54%. Once again we can notice here how cyber- and
physical- security measures can complement one another if
chosen in an integrated manner. It would however be impos-
sible to completely neutralize the impact of the considered
cyber-physical attack on the power grid operation cost, since
the deployment of the procured reserve also comes at a
cost. It is also interesting to acknowledge that the cyber-
physical planner’s optimal decision making includes updating
the firewall rules for buses 15 and 23. We recall from case
B that these would form the optimal attack vector for the
attacker with advanced capabilities. The results for case E are,
as anticipated, identical to those of case B. Since both these
cases concern an attacker with advanced capabilities only, the
cyber-security measures are ineffective hence the respective
resource limit is immaterial. Comparing results for cases F and
D, we find that, for this specific benchmark, the consideration
that a cyber-physical attacker may find a way to overcome the
applied cyber-security measures has a moderate effect on the
optimal decisions of the planner regarding physical security
measures and no effect on the optimal decisions regarding
cyber-security measures. Indeed, the only difference is in the
optimal reserve & dispatch cost which is only increased by
0.19%. It appears preferable, to tolerate a larger expected
impact of a potential attack on the power grid operation cost,
and precisely increased by 14.24%.

SOLUTION OVERVIEW FOR TEST CASES G – I
Table IV concerns the test cases on the 118-bus benchmark.
We make an interesting observation by comparing the out-
comes for cases G and I. Recall that case G only acknowl-
edges the possibility of a cyber-physical attacker with basic
capabilities while case I also acknowledges the possibility of
an attacker with the advanced capabilities to overcome cyber-
security measures. As per our results, the optimal choice of
which buses to protect by means of updated firewall rules
is different between these two cases. Again, the reason is

the synergy between cyber- and physical- security measures.
The hypothesis in case I calls for different physical-security
measures, serving as the optimal way to counterbalance the
threat posed by the cyber-physical attacker with advanced
capabilities. These physical measures would also be effective
for the alternative of the attacker with basic capabilities,
providing a form of security and leading to a different choice
of (complementary) cyber-security measures.

TABLE V
CC&G ALGORITHM EVOLUTION FOR TEST CASE I
Table V details the evolution of the problem optimal solution
as per the C&CG algorithm for test case I. Per iteration,
the 2ndcolumn of this table holds the indices of the buses
wherein the cyber-physical planner would decide to update
the firewall rules. The 3rdand 4thcolumns hold the attack
vectors launched by the cyber-physical attackers with basic
and advanced capabilities in response to the planner’s updated
decisions. The last two columns show the cost of the optimal
physical security measures and the total cost of the cyber-
physical planner ( i.e., her objective).
At the 1stiteration of the algorithm, the cyber-physical planner
considers no credible threat and thus implements no security
measure. Both attackers would in such case launch the same
attack vector since none of them is impeded by any barrier.
Acknowledging this possibility, at the 2nditeration, the cyber-
physical planner chooses to both (i) completely neutralize the
attack vector of the attacker with basic capabilities (by updat-
ing firewall rules) and (ii) mitigate the potential impact of the
alternative attacker with advanced capabilities (by changing
the generation dispatch and procuring reserve capacity). It
is also interesting to comment on the solution for iteration
4. Since the planner’s resource limit is set at 3, she may
not completely neutralize the subset of attack vectors for the
attacker with basic capabilities. This subset already includes
3 alternative pairs of buses and therefore requires 5 resources
to be rendered ineffectual. Notice that bus 69 is common in
two of these attack vectors. The planner’s optimal decision is
to spread her resources to partially mitigate each one of these3 alternative vectors rather than completely neutralize one of
them. Doing so, the planner is seeking to ensure that there is
no attack vector with considerably high impact that would also
push the expectation term and the overall objective higher. It
is also interesting that bus 69 is not one of the buses to be
protected by the available cyber-security resources. We found
that this bus would also be targeted by the cyber-physical
attacker with advanced capabilities and infer that physical
security measures have been chosen to mitigate this threat.
It is also obvious from Table V that, as anticipated, the cyber-
physical attacker with advanced capabilities only reacts to an
update of the physical security measures. Indeed, between iter-
ations where these measures are not updated this actor would
repeatedly launch the same vector ( e.g., between iterations 6
and 7). We should explain here that it is not necessary for the
planner to update both cyber- and physical- security measures
at every iteration, since seeking to co-optimize her planning
cost along with the joint expectation of the attack impact over
the set of credible attackers. We also notice that the cyber-
physical attacker with advanced capabilities would frequently
return to the same attack vector (buses 69,80) even when
the physical- security measures seem to change. The updated
dispatching and reserve decisions reduce the expected impact
of this vector, however it still remains the best choice for this
attacker relatively to her other options. We finally remark that
while the total cost for the cyber-physical planner can only
increase between different iterations, the optimal mix between
1stand 2ndstage costs is not necessarily constant. This explains
why the reserve & dispatch cost appears to decrease between
some successive iterations.
Computational Cost
Our implementation of the C&CG algorithm for the resolution
of tri-level optimization problem (1 – 22) was written in Julia
[16], using the JuMP modeling language [17]. We used the
PowerModels.jl package [18] for parsing the benchmark data
and solved all optimization problem instances with the CPLEX
solver [19]. All test cases where solved using a MacBook with
an 8-core M2 chip and 24 GB of RAM.

COMPUTATIONAL COST
Bulk Power System Dynamics and Control - XII, June 2025, Sorrento, Italy
Table VI reports the computational cost of all test cases in
terms of the total execution time and number of iterations. The
effect of the size of the considered system is obvious. We may
also notice by comparing the data for cases A – C to those for
cases D – F that the assumed resource constraint of the cyber-
physical planner has a marginal effect on computational cost.
On the other hand, we have found that the assumed value for
a cyber-physical attacker’s resource constraint has a multifold
effect on the computational cost. Firstly, it generally increases
the number of iterations required to achieve convergence.
As the algorithm requires more iterations to converge to
the optimal solution, the Master Problem also requires more
execution time per iteration to be solved. Finally, marginally
increasing the resource limit also increases the execution time
required to solve each instance of the Bi-level Sub-problem (9
– 22). Table VII demonstrates these effects by documenting
the computational cost of variants of case C with additional
resources available to both alternative cyber-physical attackers.

Conclusions
In this paper we focused on the threat posed by (malicious)
cyber-physical attackers, who may use the cyber sub-system
of the power grid as the medium to disrupt the continuous
supply of electricity. The topic is rather timely not only due
to the increasing role of digital monitoring, control, commu-
nications and computations infrastructures in the operation of
the modern power grid but, unfortunately, also due to geo-
political developments. The salient feature of this work is the
acknowledgment that even though cyber-security measures can
be effective, a sophisticated threat actor may eventually find a
(new) way to circumvent these. We therefore investigated the
stakes for an integrated risk management approach choosing
both cyber- and physical- security measures under uncertainty
on the effectiveness of the former.
To do so, we formalized an optimization problem from the
perspective of a cyber-physical planner seeking to co-optimize
her costs along with the expected impact of a cyber-physical
attack on the power grid operation cost. The latter includes a
cost of energy not supplied component, penalizing the event of
an attack leading to electricity supply interruption. The plan-
ner faces a distribution of alternative credible cyber-physical
attackers, including attackers that can overcome cyber-security
measures. Our main finding is a dual synergy between cyber-
and physical security measures. The use of physical- securitymeasures was shown to be primarily associated to the potential
ineffectiveness of cyber-security measures. Put simply, an
attacker who may overcome cyber-security measures would
be counteracted by preparing the physical grid to withstand
her attack vector. As a secondary effect, taking physical
security measures against this credible threat makes the grid
physically stronger, thus more able to withstand any credible
threat. In fine, this physically stronger grid may have different
vulnerabilities and different priorities/needs for cyber-security.
There is therefore scope for choosing cyber- and physical-
security measures in an integrated manner.
It is relevant to mention here the distinctive features of the
considered threat with respect to the ‘classical’, physical-only
threats to the security of the electric power grid, such as
component outages (a.k.a. contingencies) and power injection
forecasting errors. While physical-only threats are purely ex-
ogenous and show relatively favorable statistical properties,
cyber-physical threats are adaptive to the security manage-
ment strategy and intentionally designed for the maximum
attainable impact. To represent these features mathematically,
we adopted the framework of tri-level optimization (under
uncertainty). Admittedly, the solvability of our tri-level op-
timization framework comes with restrictions that we have
imposed on the representation of the grid physics and of its
real-time control problem statement (steady-state and linear
power flow model, with only continuous real-time controls
and no infeasibility). These restrictions however do not seem
critical for the conceptual question we address here and the
qualitative conclusion we reach. It is nevertheless desirable to
overcome these restrictions in order to develop more realistic
solution strategies to more advanced versions of the integrated
cyber-physical power grid security management problem.
We remark here that these solvability restrictions mostly refer
to the lowest-level optimization problem (16 – 22) used by
a cyber-physical attacker so as to anticipate the power grid
operator’s optimal reaction. One may argue that in practice
cyber-physical attackers are equally bound by similar solvabil-
ity restrictions and would have to resort to similar simplifying
assumptions in order to identify and launch near optimal attack
vectors. In this spirit, a possible next research step would be to
differentiate between the physical model used in (16 – 22) to
determine the optimal attack vector(s) of the considered cyber-
physical attacker(s) and the physical model used to assess and
control the impact of such attack vector(s) on the power grid.
Indeed, there is no a priori restriction in using a more detailed
physical model neither in the so-called Master Problem nor in
an additional post-processing step. This additional step would
serve to evaluate more precisely an upper bound given the
resolution of all Bilevel Sub-problem(s) and the respective
attack vector(s).
The computational cost of the tri-level optimization framework
is clearly also an issue that requires dedicated attention and
further research. In spite of such cost, we relied on this
Bulk Power System Dynamics and Control - XII, June 2025, Sorrento, Italy
framework since it offers the transparency/interpretability re-
quired for the analysis we sought to perform here. Several
improvements in algorithmic efficiency are conceivable on
top of the basic implementation that we used, including for
instance the resolution of Bi-level Sub-problem(s) in parallel
over the credible set of cyber-physical attackers. We wish to
also acknowledge the potential interest in moving away from
approaches purely based on analytical optimization techniques.
The particular alternative approach that we aim to explore
in future research is Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning .
We refer the interested reader to [20] for a comprehensive
exposition of the relevance of using Reinforcement Learning
for cyber-physical system security management.
As a concluding point, we return to the original question
and the integration of cyber- and physical- resources for
electric power system security management. We have shown
here that the integration of such resources is indeed well-
justifiable, especially given the risk that malicious adversaries
may develop the skill to overcome cyber-security measures.
We showed this while focusing on a single instance of power
power grid operation setting and on cyber- and physical-
measures that could conceivably be chosen on similar time-
frames. Addressing the electric-power system cyber-physical
security management problem as a multi-stage stochastic de-
cision making problem is the end goal of this research stream.

Abstract —Cyber ranges mimic real-world cyber environments
and are in high demand. Before building their own cyber ranges,
organizations need to deeply understand what construction
supplies are available to them. A fundamental supply is the
cyber range architecture, which prompts an important research
question: Which cyber range architecture is most appropriate
for an organization’s requirements? To answer this question,
we propose an innovative framework to specify cyber range
requirements, characterize cyber range architectures (based on
our analysis of 45 cyber range architectures), and match cyber
range architectures to cyber range requirements.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Cyber range is an emerging technology that can aptly
leverage the dynamic and informative interactions between
attackers and defenders in cyberspace to mimic a real-world
cyber environment. As organizations across many industry
sectors have increased their technological and cyberspace foot-
print, their demand for cyber ranges have likewise increased.
While there are commercial cyber ranges, there is a lack of
treatment with scientific rigor, which is important because the
current design of cyber ranges are heuristic or experience-
based. As a consequence, customers have no choice but to
passively adopt what is offered by cyber range vendors.
In this paper, we advocate treating cyber range as a new
kind of cybersecurity instrument and studying it with scientific
rigor. This is important, for example, to help organizations
choose the most appropriate cyber ranges according to their
requirements, help organizations customize their own cyber
ranges, and provide significant insights into future cyber range
design and development.
Our Contributions . We make two contributions. First, we
formulate three research questions to guide the design of cyber
ranges: (i) How should we specify cyber range requirements?
(ii) How should we characterize cyber range architectures?
(iii) How should we map available cyber range architectures
to given cyber range requirements? Second, we propose an
innovative conceptual framework to systematically address
these research questions, by defining 22 attributes to specify
cyber range requirements, proposing six cyber range archi-
tectures, which we abstract from 45 real-world cyber rangearchitectures; and proposing an algorithm that matches cyber
range architectures to satisfy an organization’s needs.
Paper Outline . The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section II details the proposed framework. Section III reviews
related prior studies. Section IV concludes the paper.
II. T HEFRAMEWORK
As highlighted in Figure 1, our framework has three
components: (i) characterizing cyber range requirements; (ii)
characterizing cyber range architectures; and (iii) designing an
algorithm to match cyber range architectures to cyber range
requirements. These components are elaborated below.

A. Characterizing Cyber Range Requirements
Cyber range demand varies greatly in terms of organiza-
tions’ requirements. For example, we see a preponderance of
cyber ranges created for cybersecurity training purposes [1]–
[5] and for testing cyber-physical systems [6]–[8]. There are
many additional use cases (such as leveraging cyber ranges
as an instrument for conducting cybersecurity research) that
highlight the need to accurately characterize cyber range re-
quirements. Fig. 2 outlines the three requirement sets, namely
purpose ,scope , and constraints , with their associated attributes
highlighted in Table I and elaborated below.
Requirement 1: Purpose . This requirement describes the
context for utilization of the cyber range and expresses its
objectives in the following attributes.
•Employment : This attribute captures the overall opera-
tional purpose of the cyber range. For example, several
commercial vendors, such as Offensive Security, offer
certifications through their cyber range scenarios. In this
case, the purpose is to evaluate and certify candidates.
•Sector : This attribute identifies the sector of coverage for
the cyber range, especially what types of objectives the

cyber range will be used for (e.g., academic requirements
can differ greatly from military ones).
•Teaming : This attribute identifies the participants and
describes the attack-defense interactions between them.
Many publicly available cyber range scenarios, such as
PicoCTF and Root-Me, focus almost exclusively on the
red (i.e., attacker) team, while a few others focus on blue
(i.e., defender) team training. However, there is a growing
demand to mimic the complex interactions of both teams.
•Scoring : This attribute identifies how user activity in the
cyber range will be scored. This is particularly impor-
tant for assessing the capabilities of red and blue team
members for real-world cyber environments.
•Tutoring : This attribute specifies the sophistication of the
instructional function of the range. This is particularly
relevant to education- and training-oriented cyber ranges.
Requirement 2: Scope . This requirement describes the extent
of functionality and usage of the cyber range. Deployment
size and complexity can vary significantly. For example, the
Kypo Cyber Range Platform can facilitate hundreds of users,
while the Kypo Cyber Sandbox Creator is for a single user via
low-resourced virtual machines (VM) [1]. This requirement is
characterized by the following attributes.
•Domain : This attribute describes the application domain
to mimic, e.g., IT versus OT networks.
•Federation : This attribute describes the required integra-
tion with other cyber ranges, such as integrating cyber
ranges into a European cyber range ecosystem [9].
•Concurrency : This attribute describes the average concur-
rent user usage (e.g., a cyber range may be designed for
use by 10 users at the same time [10]).
•Connectivity : This attribute describes the methods of user
connectivity (e.g., users may require local on-site access
to a cyber range vs. remote access via a gateway).
•Fidelity : This attribute is the degree of exactness of
the cyber range to real-world systems and networks,
measured by the average ratio of simulation to emula-
tion employed. Simulation is a higher abstraction of the
entity mimicked which only captures specific properties
desired, while emulation mimics a more substantial set
of properties, representing the entity more fully.•Duration : This attribute is the continuous deployment
duration required. For example, NATO’s cyber range for
Locked Shields requires more than 30 days in duration,
even though the exercise completes in two days [11].
•Availability : This attribute describes the user time usage
regime, such as whether cyber range scenarios will be
deployed on-demand or will be continuously available.
•Retention : This attribute is the required duration of cyber
range scenario data retention (e.g., a research-oriented
cyber range scenario may require 6 months of retention
to facilitate research investigations).
•Integration : This attribute identifies the internal integra-
tion between scenarios (e.g., two red team scenarios may
integrate into a new complex blue team defense scenario).
•Updateability : This attribute is the degree of planned up-
dates to the infrastructure and scenario sets. For example,
one cyber range design may require incremental updates
to ensure its relevance to smart campus [12].
•Scalability : This attribute is the degree of planned in-
crease in purpose and scope, where the degree is mea-
sured as the average increase across the range of values
ofpurpose andscope attributes.
Requirement 3: Constraints . This requirement describes con-
straints imposed on the cyber range designer and are associated
with the attributes of purpose andscope requirements.
•Budget : This attribute is the annual monetary funds
available for construction, lifecycle, and maintenance.
•Build Speed : This attribute is the specified average maxi-
mum time allowed to provision and deploy a cyber range,
and/or its scenario set.
•Latency : This attribute is the average permissible network
and system delay time in the cyber range.
•Staff : This attribute is the number of full-time per-
sonnel available to support administration and sched-
uled/unscheduled maintenance.
•Physical : This attribute is the non-contiguous physical
space available to house and facilitate scenarios.
•Security : This attribute describes the level of data and
process protection required to secure the cyber range
itself and to mitigate the potential damages or attacks
that may originate from the cyber range against others.
Given the preceding set of 22 attributes, where each can take
multiple values, there are many combinations of cyber range
characteristics. This means that it is not feasible to manually
characterize these numerous combinations.
B. Characterizing Cyber Range Architectures
Defining Cyber Range Architectures. From our study of 45
architectures discussed in the literature, ranging from federated
enterprise business [9], to space satellite [13], to maritime
systems [5], we define architectures (as depicted in Fig. 1)
to systematically describe the design of cyber ranges.
We note that cyber ranges are typically defined by their
functionality. Hence, functional architecture sits at the top of
the framework. Users interact with the cyber range at this layer.

Thefunctional architecture describes the runtime environment,
where assets are deployed to perform their functions (e.g., se-
curity, network, storage) and integrate with each other across a
cyber range. It also describes management functions (typically
found in the cantonment area of a cyber range) that allows
for the deployment, maintenance, and customization of portals
(i.e., user interfaces), user roles (i.e., access and permissions),
environment resources (e.g., memory, storage), monitoring
(e.g., network traffic), and the scenario lifecycle (i.e., creation,
modification, deployment, generation, and execution).
At the next layer, capabilities describes the tools that enable
the use and functionality of a cyber range. One difference of
the cyber domain from the kinetic domain is that capabilities
often come in the form of software. We cataloged 350 tools,
including cybersecurity tools, and gained the following insight:
Insight 1: Most free/publicly available cybersecurity tools
(205 of 241) are for offensive or forensics purposes.
Insight 1 makes sense as vendors have financial incentives to
produce commercial defensive risk and incident management
tools. By contrast, most commercial companies are not paying
for offensive cyber capabilities nor technical forensics tools.
The logical topology describes the various networks that
support the administration and scenario deployment of the
cyber range including the degree of cloud employment. In ex-
ploring potential topologies, we gained the following insight:
Insight 2: Within a highly managed cyber range, administra-
tive data and processes will likely interfere with the objectivesof high fidelity scenarios (e.g., experiments and certification).
Insight 2 emphasizes that highly managed cyber ranges
have sensors deployed across the cyber range for management,
monitoring, and security, which cyber range scenario develop-
ers must account for. These hardware and software sensors, as
well as the data and traffic they collect, can introduce foreign
artifacts that, for example, could corrupt the control group of
an experiment, or pollute the exam network of a certification.
Lastly, the structure defines the physical components of
the cyber range. Modern hardware systems are complicated
to configure and ensure compatibility, as well as expensive
to procure, maintain, and replace. Hence, organizations must
exercise significant foresight in structure design.
Designing Reference Architectures . We propose six refer-
ence architectures. What are common to these architectures
include: (i) each architecture contains a cantonment cluster
responsible for management and administration of the cyber
range; (ii) each cantonment cluster can leverage similar tools to
enable their management capabilities (e.g., syslog for monitor-
ing); and (iii) a DMZ is used as an example security implemen-
tation, which is replaceable with other security approaches.
Reference Architecture 1: Pure Physical . The defining charac-
teristic of this architecture is that all systems and appliances
are physically the same as their real-world counterparts that
they intend to mimic. Its capabilities are also the same in
this regard (e.g., routing and segmentation are accomplished
via physical network appliances). Fig. 3 depicts a logical
topology and structure with typical use cases directly relatable
to physical devices. The enterprise network clusters illustrate
the potentially high resource demands of this architecture.

network appliances for hardware testing, and hardware for digital forensics.
Reference Architecture 2: Centrally Virtualized . This architec-
ture emphasizes virtualization technology over physical de-
vices, significantly decreasing the complexity of the structure.
Hence, tools like Xen Server, KVM, and VirtualBox are key
capabilities to provide very high fidelity emulation. Fig. 4
depicts the logical/physical topology where entire enterprise
network clusters are virtualized within a server stack, as well
as all cantonment cluster functionalities.

(e.g., PetaSAN and XCP-ng) to enable storage pooling and virtualization.
Reference Architecture 3: On-Premise Cloud . Cloud properties
(e.g., self service capable, resource pooling, rapidly elastic)
make this architecture distinct, while its logical/physical topol-
ogy is quite similar to Fig. 4 because private clouds are enabled
by virtualization (e.g., via XCP-ng). Openstack is the main
capability to create a private cloud. However, this comes with
immense complexity, comprising of over 30 services, countless
configurations files, and at least a dozen nodes.
Reference Architecture 4: Public Cloud . The public cloud
approach benefits from cloud properties while offloading cloud
maintenance tasks to third parties that have seemingly limitless
resources (e.g., compute), though at a price. Further, the
management plane provides robust and mature capabilities. It
also natively supports automation tools like Terraform, though
core cloud capabilities are proprietary. Its topology is also
similar to Fig. 4, except it resides outside the organization.
Reference Architecture 5: Distributed Virtualization . This ap-
proach emphasizes the use of remote physical nodes (e.g.,
end-user desktops) to house cyber range scenarios. While a
cantonment cluster centrally manages the overall cyber range,
more control resides with the end-user (i.e., root user of the
desktop). Fig. 5 illustrates the logical/physical topology. A
use case is a classroom of students who only interact with
a few VMs in simple scenarios. Virtualization, micro-cloud,
containerization, and automation tools such as VirtualBox,
MicroStack, Docker, and Vagrant are key capabilities.

resource remote nodes can host VMs, containers, and/or micro-clouds.Reference Architecture 6: Hybrid . This architecture leverages
the strengths and capabilities of the other approaches, bringing
them together into a single architecture of varying densities.
Fig. 6 depicts the architecture where: a public cloud hosts
low-resourced, non-persistent VMs (decreasing subscription
cost); a private cloud hosts persistent, data-rich, and heavy
workload scenarios (leveraging cloud properties, e.g., resource
pooling); an on-premise centrally virtualized environment han-
dles medium persistent workloads (decreasing staffing cost);
distributed virtualization facilitates light persistent scenar-
ios (decreasing cost and administration); and an on-premise
physical network supports cyber-physical testing (supporting
required objectives). However, this approach has the drawback
of increasing the overall complexity of the architecture.

Through our design of the six reference architectures, we
gained the following insight:
Insight 3: It is best to employ well-maintained infrastructure
capabilities and not inject custom code patching.
Insight 3 speaks to the complexity of cyber range infras-
tructures. Well-supported hardware and software capabilities
(i.e., by regularly issued vendor patches) allow the cyber
range to grow and mature with new innovations. Conversely,
customizing cyber range deployments by directly patching
code (e.g., in the XCP-ng codebase) has a greater risk of
breaking functionality and snowballing overhead requirements.
Defining Metrics to Characterize Cyber Range Architec-
tures . Appropriate characterization of cyber range architec-
tures prior to technical design and procurement saves money
and time. This prompts us to define four categories of metrics
in light of the requirement attributes we have discussed.
Metric Category 1: Scope . In consideration of the scope of
the cyber range demand, we define two metrics. Extensibility
is the degree of ability to shift across the possible values of
the various scope requirement attributes (e.g., from a pure IT
enterprise domain to cyber-physical). Capacity is the degree
of ability to achieve the highest value levels across the various
scope requirement attributes (e.g., >1,000concurrent users).
Metric Category 2: Performance . Concerning the performance
of the cyber range, we define two metrics. Build Speed is the
amount of time (in seconds, minutes, or hours) it takes to
provision and deploy a scenario set. Latency is the amount of
average network and system delay time (in milliseconds).
Metric Category 3: Cost . Likewise, the cost of the cyber range
is defined in two metrics. Budget is the amount of annual
monetary funds required to construct and maintain the cyber
range. Staff is the number of personnel required to support
administration and maintenance of the cyber range.
Metric Category 4: Security . We propose using standard
security metrics: confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-
repudiation, authenticity, and privacy.
Analyzing Reference Architectures . We apply these metrics
at the ordinal scale and qualitatively via a Likert Scale
approach [14]. We compare the reference architectures (of a
sizeable deployment) to an average cyber range deployment
scenario (i.e., to a medium-sized organization’s enterprise
business environment). Table II summarizes our analysis,
enumerating our qualitative results and the significant strengths
and weaknesses of each architecture per metric category.
C. Matching Cyber Range Architectures to Requirements
Building a Matching Dataset . This dataset contains the
matching of each requirement attribute to each of the six archi-
tectures. We make the following definitions: (i) Supportability :
the level of ability a reference architecture is able to facilitate a
requirement attribute. (ii) Significance : the level of importance
of a requirement attribute given its value (e.g., significance of
abudget value of low is different than medium ). We apply
our domain expertise to assess supportability by qualitatively
scoring each architecture per attribute, and significance by
providing weights for each attribute per value (where the
range of values are enumerated in Table I). We then store
the resulting dataset as a CSV with the following columns: (i)
attribute name ; (ii) attribute value ; (iii) attribute weight : the
weight assigned to the attribute value; (iv) architecture scores :
for the remaining six columns, the assigned supportability
score for each reference architecture.
Automating the Matching Process . We automate the match-
ing process (as depicted in Fig 1) via a python script that
ingests the matching dataset and requirements of interest. It
outputs a score for each reference architecture, along with a
heat map to visualize and explain the score. At a high level, the
score reflects to what extent an architecture satisfies the given
cyber range requirements; the architecture with the highest
score can be used to build a cyber range. Core functions of
the script are given below:
1def score_lookup(user_input, matching_dataset):
2 for key, value inuser_input:
3 select line from matching_dataset where
(attribute == key and value == value) ,→
4 append line to score_lookup_df
5return score_lookup_df
6def score_calculation(score_lookup_df):
7 for architecture column inscore_lookup_df:
8 append sum(score_looup_df.weight *
architecture.score) to architecture_scores_df ,→
9return architecture_scores_df
The score lookup function retrieves the applicable CSV
line from the matching dataset for every requirement at-
tribute value selected by the user and provides it to thescore calculation function, which computes the score for
each reference architecture by summing the products of each
requirement attribute value’s weight and architecture score. It
outputs the score totals and provides this computed data to a
heat map generation function.
Fig. 7. Heat map depicting a sample result, where the hybrid architecture
is recommended especially because of the strong match in terms of domain,
availability, retention, scalability, and latency requirements.
Fig. 7 shows a sample output with reference architectures
indicated in the y-axis and requirement attributes indicated in
thex-axis. At a high level, the heat map provides explainability
to the result by visualizing how requirements have impacted
the selection of reference architectures.
III. R ELATED WORK
We divide related prior studies into three categories. First,
to catalog cyber ranges, there are studies on characterizing
cyber range functions [15], [16], on conducting questionnaire-
based survey of cyber range components and tools [17], on
recommending cyber ranges according to objectives [18], and
on summarizing cyber range infrastructures and capture-the-
flag environments [19]. The present study goes much beyond
these studies in terms of comprehensiveness, especially con-
cerning architectures. Second, there are studies on creating and
managing cyber ranges [20], on modeling and detecting flaws
in cyber range-based training [21], on qualitatively analyzing a
particular cyber range [22], and on assessment methodologies
for cybersecurity training platforms [23]. The present study
goes beyond them by proposing a systematic set of attributes
and metrics (e.g., extensibility and capacity) for assessing
and characterizing cyber range architectures. Third, there are
studies on extending on-premise cyber ranges to public [24]
and private cloud infrastructures [25], and on combining
virtualized and physical devices into a hybrid cyber range [26].
The present study goes beyond these studies by proposing a
systematic set of cyber range reference architectures.
IV. C ONCLUSION FOR FUTURE WORK
We have presented a framework for specifying cyber range
requirements, characterizing cyber range architectures, and
matching cyber range architectures to requirements. This study
represents a significant first step towards automating the design
of cyber ranges according to requirements.
The present study has several limitations which need to be
addressed in the future. First, the matching algorithm heavily
relies on our domain expertise; a more intelligent algorithm

ABSTRACT  
 
Cyber Security  plays an important role in the field of information technology  .Securing the information 
have become one of the biggest challenges in the present day. Wh en ever we think about the cyber 
security the first thing that comes to our mind is ‘cyber crimes’ which are increasing immensely day by 
day. Various Governments and companies are taking many measures in order to prevent these cyber 
crimes. Besides various  measures cyber security is still a very big concern to many. This paper mainly 
focuses  on challenges  faced by cyber security on the latest technologies  .It also  focuses on latest about 
the cyber security techniques , ethics  and the trends changing the face  of cyber security.  
 
Keywords: cyber security, cyber  crime,  cyber ethics, social media,  cloud computing,  android apps.  
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Today man is able to send and receive any form 
of data may be an e -mail or an audio or video 
just by the click of a b utton but did he ever 
think how securely his data id being transmitted 
or sent to the other person safely without any 
leakage of information?? The answer lies in 
cyber security. Today Internet is the fastest 
growing infrastructure in every day life.  In 
today’s technical environment many latest 
technologies are changing the face of the man 
kind. But due to these emerging technologies 
we are unable to safeguard our private 
information in a very effective way and hence 
these days cyber crimes are increasing da y by 
day. Today more than 60  percent of total 
commercial transactions are done online, so this 
field required a high quality of security for 
transparent and best transactions.  Hence cyber 
security has become a latest issue. The scope of 
cyber security is n ot just limited to securing the 
information in IT industry but also to various 
other fields like cyber space etc.  
 
 Even the latest technologies like cloud 
computing, mobile computing, E -commerce, net 
banking etc also needs high level of security. 
Since th ese technologies hold some important 
information regarding a person their security 
has become a must thing. Enhancing cyber  
security and protecting critical information 
infrastructures are essential to each nation's 
security and economic wellbeing. Making the 
Internet safer (and protecting Internet users) has 
become integral to the development of new services as well as governmental policy .   The 
fight against cyber crime needs a 
comprehensive  and a safer approach. Given that 
technical measures alone cannot  prevent any 
crime, it is critical that law enforcement 
agencies are allowed to investigate and 
prosecute cyber crime effectively . Today many 
nations and governments are imposing strict 
laws on cyber securities in order to prevent the 
loss of some importan t information.  Every 
individual must also be trained on this cyber 
security and save themselves from these 
increasing cyber crimes  
 
2. CYBER CRIME  
 
Cyber crime  is a term for any illegal activity that 
uses a computer as its primary means of 
commission  and t heft. The U.S. Department of 
Justice expands the definition of cyber crime  to 
include any illegal activity that uses a computer 
for the storage of evidence. The  growing list of 
cyber crimes  includes crimes that have been 
made possible by computers, such as  network 
intrusions and the dissemination of computer 
viruses, as well as computer -based variations of 
existing crimes, such as identity 
theft, stalking , bullying and  terrorism  which 
have become as major problem to people and 
nations. Usually in common man’s language 
cyber cr ime may be defined  as crime committed 
using a computer and the internet to steel a 
person’s identity or sell contraband or stalk 
victims or disrupt operations with malevolent 
programs. As day by day technology is playing 
in major role in a person’s life th e cyber crimes 
also will increase along with the technological 
advances.                                                                                               
3. CYBER SECURITY  
 
Privacy and security of the data will always be 
top security measures t hat any organization 
takes care. We are presently  living in a world 
where all the information is maintained in a 
digital or a cyber form. Social networking sites 
provide a space where users feel safe as they 
interact with friends and family. In the case of  
home users, cyber -criminals would continue to 
target social media sites to steal personal data . 
Not only social networking but also during bank 
transactions a person must take all the required 
security measures.

The above  Comparison of Cyber Security 
Incidents reported to Cyber999  in Malaysia  
from January –June 2012 and  2013 clearly 
exhibits the cyber security threats . As crime is 
increasing even the  security measures are also  
increasing. According to the survey of U.S. technology and healthcare executives 
nationwide, Silicon Valley Bank found that 
companies believe cyber attacks are a serious 
threat to both their data and their business 
continuity.  
 98% of companies are maintaining or 
increasing their cyber security 
resources and of those, half are 
increasing resources devoted to online 
attacks this year  
 The majority of companies are 
preparing for when, not if, cyber 
attacks occur  
 Only one -third   are c ompletely 
confident in the security of their 
information and   even less confident 
about the security mea sures of their 
business partners.  
 
There will be new attacks on Android operating 
system based d evices, but it will not be on 
massive scale. The fact ta blets share the same 
operating system as smart phones means they 
will be soon targeted by the same malware  as 
those platforms. The number of malware 
specimens for Macs would continue to grow, 
though much less than in the case of PCs. 
Windows 8  will allow u sers to develop 
applications for virtually any device (PCs, 
tablets and smart phones) running Windows 8, 
so it will be possible to develop malicious 
applications like those for Android , hence these 
are some of the predicted trends in cyber 
security.  
 
 
4. TRENDS CHANGING CYBER 
SECURITY  
 
Here mentioned below are some of the trends 
that are having a huge impact on cyber security.  
 
4.1 Web servers:  
 
The threat of attacks on web applications to 
extract data or to distribute malicious code 
persists. Cyber crimina ls distribute their 
malicious code via legitimate web servers 
they’ve compromised. But data -stealing attacks, 
many of which get the attention of media, are 
also a big threat.   Now, we  need a greater 
emphasis on protecting web servers and web 
applications.  Web servers are especially the best 
platform for these cyber criminals to steal the 
data. Hence one must always use a safer 
browser especially during important transactions 
in order not to fall as a prey for these crimes.  
 
4.2 Cloud computing and its serv ices 
 
These days all small, medium and large 
companies are slowly adopting cloud services. 
In other words the world is slowly moving 
towards the clouds . This latest trend pres ents a 
big challenge for cyber  security, as traffic can 
go around traditional poi nts of inspection. 
Additionally, as the number of applications 
available in the cloud grows, policy controls for 
web applications and cloud services will also 
need to evolve  in order to prevent the loss of 
valuable information. Though cloud services are 
developing their own models still a lot of issues 
are being brought up about their security. Cloud 
may provide immense opportunities but it 
should always be noted that as the cloud evolves 
so as its security concerns increase.  
4.3 APT’s and targeted attacks  
 
APT ( Advanced Persistent Threat) is a  whole 
new level of cyber crime ware . For years 
network security capabilities such as web 
filtering or IPS have played a key part in 
identifying such targeted attacks (mostly after 
the initial compromise). As attackers  grow 
bolder and employ more vague  techniques, 
network security must integrate with other 
security services  in order  to detect attacks.  
Hence one must improve our security techniques 
in order to prevent more threats coming in the 
future.  
 
4.4 Mobile Networ ks 
 
Today we are able to connect to anyone in any 
part of the world. But for these mobile networks 
security is a very big concern. These days 
firewalls and other security measures are 
becoming porous as people are using devices 
such as tablets, phones, PC’ s etc all of which 
again require extra securities apart from those 
present in the applications used. We must 
always think about the security issues of these 
mobile networks. Further mobile networks are 
highly prone to these cyber crimes a lot of care 
must be taken in case of their security issues.  
 
4.5 IPv6: New internet protocol  
 
IPv6 is the new Internet protocol which is 
replacing IPv4  (the older version), which has 
been a backbone of our networks in general and 
the Internet at large. Protecting IPv6 is n ot just a 
question of porting IPv4 capabilities. While 
IPv6 is a wholesale replacement in making more 
IP addresses available, there are some very 
fundamental changes to the protocol which need  to be considered in security policy.  Hence it is 
always better  to switch to IPv6 as soon as 
possible in order to reduce the risks regarding 
cyber crime.  
 
4.6 Encryption of the code  
 
Encryption  is the process of encoding messages 
(or information) in such a way that 
eavesdro ppers or hackers cannot read it. . In an  
encry ption scheme, the message or information 
is encrypted using an encryption algorithm, 
turning it into an unreadable  cipher text . This is 
usually done with the use of an  encryption key , 
which specifies how the message is to be 
encoded.  Encryption at a very beginning level 
protects data privacy and its integrity. But more 
use of encryption brings more c hallenges in 
cyber security . Encryption is also used to protect 
data in transit, for example data being 
transferred via  networks  (e.g. the  Internet , e-
commerce ), mobile telephones , wireless 
microphones , wireless intercom s etc. Hence by 
encrypting the code one can know if there is any  
leakage of information.  
 
Hence the above are some of the trends 
changing the face of cyber security in the world.  
The top network threats are  mentioned in below 
Fig -1. 
 
 
                           Fig -1 
 
The above pie chart shows about the major 
threats for networks and cyber security.  
 
5. ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN 
CYBER SECURITY  
 
As we become more social in an increasingly 
connecte d world, companies must find new 
ways to protect personal information.  Social 
media plays a huge role in cyber security and 
will contribute a lot to personal cyber threats . 
Social  media adoption among personnel is 
skyrocketing and so is the threat of attac k. Since 
social media or social networking sites are 
almost used by most of them every day it has 
become a huge platform for the cyber criminals 
for hacking private information and stealing 
valuable data.  
 
In a world where we’re quick to give up our 
perso nal information, companies have to ensure 
they’re just as quick in identifying threats, 
responding in real time, and avoiding a breach 
of any kind.  Since people are easily attracted by 
these social media the hackers use them as a bait 
to get the informatio n and the data they require. 
Hence people must take appropriate measures 
especially in dealing with social media in order 
to prevent the loss of their information.  
The ability of individuals to share information 
with an audience of millions is at the heart  of the 
particular challenge that social media presents to 
businesses. In addition to giving anyone the 
power to disseminate commercially sensitive 
information, social media also gives the same 
power to spread false information, which can be 
just being as damaging. The  rapid spread of 
false information through social media is among 
the emerging risks identified  in Global Risks 
2013  report.  
Though social media can be used for cyber 
crimes these companies  cannot afford to stop 
using social media as it plays an important role 
in publicity of a company .  Instead, they must 
have solutions that will notify them of the threat 
in order to fix it before any real damage is done.  
However companies should understand  this and 
recognise the importance of analysing the 
information especially in social conversations 
and provide appropriate security solutions in 
order to stay away from risks. O ne must handle 
social media by using certain policies and right 
technologies.  
6. CYBER  SECURITY  TECHNIQUES  
6.1 Access control and password security  
The concept of user name and password has 
been fundamental way of protecting our 
information. This may be one of the first 
measures regarding cyber security.  
6.2 Authentication  of data  
The documents that we receive must always be 
authenticated be before downloading that is it should be checked if it has originated from a 
trusted and a reliable source and that they are 
not altered. Authenticating of these documents 
is usually done by the an ti virus software present 
in the devices. Thus a good anti virus software is 
also essential to protect the devices from viruses.  
6.3 Malware scanners  
This is software that usually scans all the files 
and documents present in the system for 
malicious code o r harmful viruses .  Viruses , 
worms, and Trojan horses are examples of 
malicious software that are often grouped 
together and referred to as malware.  
6.4 Firewalls  
A firewall is  a software program or piece of 
hardware that helps screen out hackers, viruses, 
and worms that try to reach your computer over 
the Internet.  All messag es entering or leaving 
the inter net pass through the firewall  present , 
which examines each message and blocks those 
that do not meet the specified  security  criteria . 
Hence firewalls play an important role in 
detecting the malware.  
6.5 Anti -virus software  
Antivirus software is a computer program t hat 
detects, prevents, and takes action to disarm or 
remove malicious software programs, such as 
viruses and worms. Most antivirus programs 
include an auto -update feature that enables the 
program to download profiles of new viruses so 
that it can check for  the new viruses as soon as 
they are discovered.   An anti virus software is a 
must and basic necessity for every system.  
 
Table II: Techniques on cyber security  
7 CYBER  ETHICS  
Cyber ethics are nothing but the code of the 
internet. When we practice these cyber ethics 
there are good chances of us using the internet 
in a proper and safer way. The below are a few 
of them:  
 DO use the Internet to communicate 
and interact with other people . Email 
and instant messaging make it easy to 
stay in touch with friends and family 
members, communicate with work 
colleagues, and share ideas and 
information with people across town or 
halfway around the world  
 Don’t be a bully on the Internet.  Do not 
call people names, lie about them, send 
embarrassing pictures of them, or do 
anything else to try to hurt them.   
 Internet is considered as world’s largest 
library with information on any topic in 
any subject area, so using this 
information in a cor rect and legal way 
is always essential.  
 Do not operate others accounts using 
their passwords.  
 Never try to send any kind of malware 
to other’s systems and make them 
corrupt.  
 Never share your personal information 
to anyone as there is a good chance of 
others misusing it and finally you 
would end up in a trouble.  
 When you’re online never pretend to 
the other person, and never try to create 
fake accounts on someone else as it 
would land you as well as the other 
person into trouble.  
 Always adhere to copyrighte d 
information and download games or 
videos only if they are permissible.  
The above are a few cyber ethics one must 
follow while using the internet.  We are always 
thought proper rules from out very early stages 
the same here we apply in cyber space.  
8. CONC LUSION  
Computer security is a vast topic that is 
becoming more important because the world is 
becoming highly interconnected, with networks 
being used to carry out critical transactions.  
Cyber crime continues to diverge down different 
paths with each New Y ear that passes  and so 
does the security of the information.  The latest 
and disruptive technologies, along with the new 
cyber tools and threats that come to light each day, are challenging organizations with not only 
how they secure their infra structure, b ut how 
they require  new platforms and intelligence to 
do so.  There is no perfect solution for cyber 
crimes but we should try our level best to 
minimize them in order to have a safe and 
secure future in cyber space.

Abstract —It is a well- known fact that today a nation’s 
telecommunication networks, critical infrastructure, and 
information systems are vulnerable to growing number of attacks 
in cyberspace. Cyber space contains very different problems involving various sets of threats, targets and costs. Cyber security 
is not only problem of banking, communication or transportation. It also threatens core systems of  army as command control.   
Some significant recommendations  on command control (C2) and 
cyber security have been suggested for army computing environment in this paper. This  study addresses priorities of 
“what should be done for a better army cyber future”  to cyber
security researchers.  
Index Terms —Command Control (C2), Army, Future 
Operations, Cyber Security. 
I. INTRODUCTION
NITIALY, wars were conducted via physical instruments 
and signs like whistles or flags.  Especially with the usage of 
telegraph in Crimean War [1] in the 19th century, remote 
command and control (C2) became possible. The rapid development of the instruments like satellites [2] within the space dimension increased the range of C2, while the 
improvement of ground positioning systems [3] increased the 
precision of C2, and lastly co mputers and internet increased 
the obscurity of C2.[4] 
Although the C2 instruments have changed through the 
history [5], its crucial role in warfare has kept its importance; 
it is a necessity to have sheltered, mobile, and modern C2 centers, while it is indispensa ble to train the leaders to 
effectively put to use this capability [6].
The more electronics and mobile devices are improved the 
more the air, land, sea, and sp ace become cyber environments 
[7]. The cyber security became a state issue, where a cyber-
threat for a security system of a state is accepted as a casus belli. Cyber-attack has been defined as “an attack, via 
cyberspace, targeting an enterpris e’s use of cyberspace for the

controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled 
information” by National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) [8]. Besides the cyber defense and cyber-attack capability has also gained importance; however, there is no sufficient legal basis for such an operation [9]. That is why, states focus on identifying the imminent threat and staving it 
off by state-sponsored (non-state) cyber-attacks, instead of directly applying it.  
II.W
HAT SHOULD BEDONE FOR A BETTER CYBER FUTURE ? 
A. Purpose of the Study 
Complexity of modern cyber security is increasing all over 
the world. Today it is a fact that manage cyber threats and cyber incidents without leveraging various collaboration 
instruments with different partners is not possible.  Cyber-
attacks constitute a serious challenge to national security and 
demand greater attention from all public and civil 
establishments. This study men tion main topics about cyber 
security especially for army. The main issues needed to be 
done in terms of future oper ational environments’ command 
control and cyber security are given below. 
B. Main Issues fo r Cyber Security  
Interoperability is a fundamental principle for the operation 
of joint and coalition forces (Fig.1). Army should have the capability to operate in any plac e of the world with the ability 
of “interoperability for joint and coalition operations”. It is 
also crucial that the joint situa tional picture of the operational 
area be presented to joint headquarters. Additionally, cross-
functional structure among the systems should be formed, and centralized C2 systems should be  transformed to decentralized 
C2 systems.  
It is a necessity to introduce programs about cyber security 
in the universities and to encour age the education of qualified 
individuals about it. The purpose of the cyber exercises held 
by armies or scientific centers, should be to create awareness. 
The situational awareness will not be sufficient in future’s 
sophisticated and ambiguous enviro nment. In order to provide 
all of the functional areas in a C2 headquarters work jointly, 
situational awareness should be improved by detecting the Recommendations on Future Operational 
Environment s’Command Control and Cyber 
Security

factors in the environment, appr ehending the current situation, 
and envisaging the future situation (tendency awareness). 
Fig.1. Interoperability [10] 
The armies will increase their Network Enabled Capabilities 
(NEC) in order to eradicate the obscurity of the chaotic future 
warfare environments, and to provide right information, in the 
right time, and in the right place (Fig.2) [10]. However, the 
more the NEC improved, the more the systems/platforms will 
be exposed to cyber- attacks. ‘Embedded Cyber Security 
Technique’ and ‘Operational Area Identification and 
Introduction Systems’ [ 11] should be used to restrain from 
those attacks.  
Fig. 2.  Army network enabled capability [10] 
It is of high importance that an Army, which has mission 
functions that entails different C2 structures, must have the 
capability to conduct via a single and centralized C2 system. In 
addition to this, special weaponry systems for army should be 
compatible for a sophisticated C2. Today the C2 systems in army, depends on software and hardware, which are open to 
cyber- attacks. Thus, ‘National Tactic Data Link’ is necess ary 
for securing the systems.  
Internet search engines ar e the most sophisticated spy 
software of the world, since they store all of the data about the users and draw the data map of the world [12]. They can provide the educational levels of the countries, the contacts of 
the individuals, their social cir cles, and expenses (Fig.3). This 
capability renders those engi nes as the indispensable 
environment for intelligence that is able to analyze so much 
data. In order to preserve from the threats of that capability, it 
is vital to use complicated passwords and to use these systems quantum sufficit. 
 
 
Fig. 3. Search engine usage sample [13] 
Depending on the last developments on Cryptology, 
authentication, access control (for 2 or more people), authorization, strong authentication mechanisms, fast and low-
source-spending crypto algor ithms, asymmetric crypto 
algorithms resistant to quantum computers (rather than symmetric crypto) should be us ed in order to provide data 
security of the NEC systems. It is known that trying to secure 
all kinds of data may decrease the effectiveness of the systems or put systems out of action. Thus, it is essential that, which 
data is worth security, be decided effectively. Instead of commencing the crisis  and operations process with intelligence 
function and following with operation function, the process 
should be defined from the crisis phase cross functionally and 
jointly. 
Network enabled capability gains the upper hand. In order to 
make use of this capability, it is vital to have communications 
networks that enable current sy stems, platforms, and nodal 
points function together. Additio nally, information and nodal 
systems are required to pr ocess the data and prepare it 
compatible with the users’ need s. Moreover, an organization 
structure and a training system (of the users and the decision 
makers) that effectively profits from the network-enabled 
capability are indispensable.

RECOMMENDATIONS ON FUTURE OPERATIONA L ENVIRONMENTS’ COMMAND CONTROL…..
C.Command Control and Tactical Issues  
In the near future, robotic armies and unmanned land 
vehicles will be under command, and most of the 
platforms/systems will depend on satellites. In order to remove weaknesses stemming from satellite signal intervention, a ‘National GPS System’ is vital. By using national GPS system 
Decision Support Systems may provide alternative solutions 
about deployment of artillery weapons and weapon systems, ammunition effect analysis, desired effect, the sort and amount of the ammunition. Metro techniques affect hit rate % 67 
percent in the long-range. In this regard, service-based metro
systems will be widespread. It  is possible to take better 
decisions than the previous  ones, and artificial intelligence 
systems may be helpful for understanding the intention/course 
of action of the enemy using Learning Systems.  
‘Vetronics’ systems  were introduced with the developments 
in the land vehicles (Fig.4) [14],[15]. In the middle of the 
battle, if the commander needs to  change his vehicle due to 
mechanic problems, he will have the capability to use the new vehicle as a command and control vehicle with the help of ‘mountable systems’  [16]. 
With the help of tactic wireless net communication system 
applications, all of the forces, particularly Navy, will have the 
capability to communicate worldwide securely, based on 
completely national means.  
Studies and researches are in pr ogress on the use of ‘Service 
Based Architecture’ by the mobile elements on the field and on
the tactical field communication nets. It is predictable that 
service based architecture will be used on a broader band in between command centers over brigade level in the short and 
medium term. The C2 systems situational awareness will be 
available for the single soldier on the field as well as the high 
level command, parallel to the te chnologic dev elopments, and 
functional capabilities will incr ease with that. Identification 
system is as important as detection system on the unmanned aerial vehicles, in that context, by help of Terahertz 
technology, which follows the terahertz rays that objects radiate, the identification of the weapons, explosive, chemical, 
and biological materials and similar security inspections will 
be available.   
It is possible to use network enabled capability in strategic, 
operative, and tactic levels; however, it will be difficult to use 
it in single soldier / single vehicle level regarding the hardships of the combat. Thus, it is vital to define the levels 
that network enabled capabilities  are planned to operate.  
With the help of a data exchan ge system, different platforms 
should have the ability to activate the weapon systems of each 
other. Most of the systems in army are compatible with 
platform-based operation, rather than network enabled ones, 
which may cause problems in the long run.

III. C ONCLUSION
Recommendations on future operational environments’ 
command control and cyber security has been discussed in this paper. The studies’  goal is to make curi ous researchers some 
main topics about army and cyber security issues.  
It is known that in order to form a new effective defense 
technology base, focused on the needs of army, long term planning, application, and tracking activities should be 
handled with strategic management approach [18],[19]. In this 
context, regarding command, control and information technologies excellence nets C4ISR technologies, which are 
compatible with network centric capability, should be 
prioritized.  Autonomous comma nd and control technologies 
in land, navy and air force vehicles, real time data integration and data fusion, cyber de fense, strategy and tactics 
improvement, protected core, and national nets should also be 
prioritized.   
It is fundamental that national software and hardware be 
used in order to be secure from or least affected from threats. 
Human-education-technology synergy be provided for a 
sufficient cyber defense, and th at a national cyber army and a 
cyber-defense supreme board be formed. It is also important to

promote a cyber-market while improving the research & 
development about cyber security.  
One of the fundamental concept in battlefield environment is 
information flow and security of obtained information. It is 
well known fact by cyber ex perts that physical components 
added to a cyber-system considerably increase the difficulty of determining information flow.  
Todays’ armies have sophisticated command control 
infrastructures includes complex interactions of cyber components. Confidentiality of  operational environment 
requires advanced security integration models. I believe that this work provides an approach for some of the complexities involved in command control and cyber security protection for 
army.

1. Introduction
Cyberspace has come to be an integral part of our society. Government agencies, schools, hospitals, corporations,
ﬁnancial institutions and other organizations ceaselessly collect, process, and store a great deal of data on computers
and transmit these conﬁdential data across networks to other computers [1, 2]. However, cyberspace is vulnerable
to a wide range of cyber threats. Sophisticated cyber perpetrators exploit vulnerabilities to steal information and
money and develop capabilities to disrupt and destroy essential cyber services. In light of the risk and potential
consequences of cyber attacks, strengthening the security and resilience of cyberspace has become an important
mission. Cybersecurity is committed to protecting computers, networks, programs and data from unintended or
unauthorized access, change, or destruction [3–5]. You cannot manage if you cannot measure. Before working out
cyberspace security solutions, the security of cyber networks must be evaluated [6–8].

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a newly emerging class of cyber attacks. With a clear goal, an APT
attack is highly targeted, well-organized, well-resourced, covert and long-term [9–11]. APTs pose a severe threat to
cyberspace, because they invalidate conventional cyber defense mechanisms. In the last decade, the number of APTs
increased rapidly and numerous security incidents were reported all over the world [12]. For the purpose of resisting
APTs, it is vital to evaluate the security of cyber networks under APTs. However, due to the persistence of APTs,
existing security evaluation methods are not applicable to APTs [13–17]. Recently, Pendleton et al. [18] considered
the expected fraction of compromised nodes in a cyber network as a security metric of the network. As the fraction is
varying over time, its availability is questionable.
To measure the security of a cyber network under APTs, an APT-based cyber attack-defense process must be
modeled as a continuous-time dynamical system. The individual-level dynamical modeling technique, which has
been applied to areas such as epidemic spreading [19–21], malware spreading [22–29], rumor spreading [30, 31] and
viral marketing [32], is especially suited to the modeling of APT-based cyber attack-defense processes, because the
topological structure of the targeted cyber network can be accommodated [33]. Towards this direction, a number of
APT-based cyber attack-defense models have been proposed [34–36]. In particular, Zheng et al. [37] found that a
special APT-based cyber attack-defense model exhibits a global stability.
This paper focuses on estimating security of cyber networks under APTs. First, an APT-based cyber attack-
defense process is modeled as an individual-level dynamical system. Second, the dynamic model is shown to exhibit
the global stability. On this basis, a new security metric of cyber networks, which is known as the limit security, is
deﬁned as the limit expected fraction of compromised nodes in the networks. Next, the inﬂuence of di erent factors
on the limit security is illuminated through theoretical analysis and computer simulation. This work helps understand
the security of cyber networks under APTs.
The remaining materials are organized this way. Section 2 derives an APT-based cyber attack-defense model.
Section 3 shows the global stability of the model and deﬁnes the limit security of cyber networks. The inﬂuence of
dierent factors on the limit security is made clear in Sections 4 and 5. Finally, Section 6 closes this work.
2. The modeling of APT-based cyber attack-defense processes
For the purpose of evaluating the security of a cyber network under APTs, understanding the relevant cyber attack-
defense process is requisite. This is the goal of this section.
2.1. The cyber network
LetG=(V;E) denote the network interconnecting computers in a given cyber network, where V=f1;;Ng,
each node represents a computer in the cyber network, and there is an edge from node ito node jif and only if
2
computer iis allowed to deliver messages directly to computer jthrough the network. Let A=
ai j
NNdenote the
adjacency matrix for G. Hereafter, Gis assumed to be strongly connected.
In what follows, it is assumed that, at any time, every node in the cyber network is either secure orcompromised ,
where all secure nodes are under the defender’s control, and all compromised nodes are under the attacker’s control.
LetXi(t)=0 and 1 denote that node iis secure and compromised at time t, respectively. Then the state of the cyber
network at time tis represented by the vector
X(t)=(X1(t);X2(t);;XN(t)):
LetSi(t) and Ci(t) denote the probability of node ibeing secure and compromised at time t, respectively.
Si(t)=PrfXi(t)=0g;Ci(t)=PrfXi(t)=1g:
AsSi(t)+Ci(t)1, the vector C(t)=(C1(t);;CN(t))Trepresents the expected state of the cyber network at time t.
2.2. The attack and defense mechanisms
The threat of an APT attack to the cyber network is twofold.
External attack , which is conducted by the external attacker, with the intent of compromising the secure nodes
in the network. The attack strength to secure node iisxi, wherestands for the technical level of external
attack, xistands for the resource per unit time used for attacking node i,PN
i=1xi>0.
Internal infection , which is caused by the compromised nodes in the network, with the intent of compromising
the secure nodes in the network. The infection strength of compromised node ito secure node jisai j, where
stands for the technical level of internal infection. The combined infection strength to secure node iat time t

, where 1 Astands for the indicator function of event A,f(0)=0,f(x)xfor all x0,
fis strictly increasing and concave, and fis second continuously di erentiable.
We refer to the vector x=(x1;;xN) as an attack scheme. The resource per unit time for the attack scheme xis
jjxjj1=PN
i=1xi, wherejjjj 1stands for the 1-norm of vectors. .
The defense of the cyber network against APTs is also twofold.
Prevention, which aims to prevent the secure nodes in the cyber network from being compromised. The pre-
vention strength of secure node iisyi, wherestands for the technical level of prevention, yi>0 stands for
the resource per unit time used for preventing node i.
Recovery, which is intended to recover the compromised nodes in the cyber network. The recovery strength of
compromised iiszi, wherestands for the technical level of recovery, zi>0 stands for the resource per unit
time for recovering node i.

We refer to the vector y=(y1;;yN) as a prevention scheme, the vector z=(z1;;zN) as a recovery scheme,
and the vector ( y;z) as a defense scheme. The resources per unit time for the prevention scheme y, the recovery
scheme yand the defense scheme ( y;z) arejjyjj1,jjzjj1andjjyjj1+jjzjj1, respectively.
Letw=(w1;;wN) denote an attack scheme or a prevention scheme or a recovery scheme. In the subsequent
study, the following two schemes will be used.

2.3. The modeling of APT-based cyber attack-defense processes
For the purpose of modeling APT-based cyber attack-defense processes, the following assumptions are made.
(A1) Due to external attack, at any time secure node igets compromised at ratexi
yi. This assumption is rational,
because the rate is proportional to the attack strength and is inversely proportional to the prevention strength.
(A2) Due to internal infection, at any time secure node igets compromised at ratef
PN
j=1aji1fxj(t)=1g
yi. This assumption
is rational, because the rate is proportional to the combined infection strength and is inversely proportional to
the prevention strength.
(A3) Due to recovery, at any time compromised node ibecomes secure at rate zi. This assumption is rational,
because the rate is proportional to the recovery strength.
Next, let us model the cyber attack-defense process. Let tbe a very small time interval. Following the above
assumptions, we have that, for i=1;;N;t0,
PrfXi(t+ t)=1jXi(t)=0g=t
yi26666664xi+f0BBBBBB@NX
j=1ajiCj(t)1CCCCCCA37777775+o(t);
PrfXi(t+ t)=0jXi(t)=1g=zit+o(t):

Invoking the total probability formula, rearranging the terms, dividing both sides by t, and letting t!0, we get a
dynamic model as follows.

We refer to the model as the generic secure-compromised-secure (GSCS) model, because the function fmeets a set of
generic conditions. The diagram of state transitions of node iunder this model is given in Fig. 1. To a certain extent,
the GSCS model accurately captures APT-based cyber attack-defense processes.

3. Theoretical analysis of the GSCS model
This section is dedicated to studying the dynamical properties of the GSCS model.
3.1. Preliminaries
For fundamental knowledge on di erential dynamical systems, see Ref. [38].
Lemma 1. (Chaplygin Lemma, see Theorem 31.4 in [39]) Consider a smooth n-dimensional system of di erential
equations
dx(t)
dt=f((x(t));t0
and the corresponding system of di erential inequalities
dy(t)
dtf((y(t));t0
with x(0)=y(0). Suppose that for any a 1;;an0, there hold
fi(x1+a1;;xi 1+ai 1;xi;xi+1+ai+1;;xn+an)fi(x1;;xn);i=1;;n:
Then y(t)x(t)for t0.

For fundamental knowledge on ﬁxed point theory, see Ref. [40].
Lemma 2. (Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem, see Theorem 4.10 in [40]) Let D be a nonempty, bounded, closed and
convex subset of Rn, and let f :D!D be a continuous function. Then f has a ﬁxed point.
For fundamental knowledge on matrix theory, see Ref. [41]. Let diag(ai) denote the diagonal matrix with diagnoal
entries a1;a2;;aN, and let col(ai) denote the column vector of components a1;a2;;aN. This paper considers
only real square matrices. For a matrix A, lets(A) denote the maximum real part of an eigenvalue of A.AisMetzler
if its o -diagonal entries are all nonnegative.
Lemma 3. (Section 2.1 in [42]) Let Abe an irreducible Metzler matrix. Then the following claims hold.
(a) If there is a positive vector xsuch that Ax<x, then s (A)<.
(b) If there is a positive vector xsuch that Ax=x, then s (A)=.
(c) If there is a positive vector xsuch that Ax>x, then s (A)>.

So,

3.3. The equilibrium
Theorem 1. The GSCS model admits a unique equilibrium. Denote this equilibrium by C=(C
1;;C
N)T. Then
C
i>0;CiC
iCi;1iN.
Proof. LetK=QN
i=1h
Ci;Cii
. Deﬁne a continuous mapping H=(H1;;HN)T:K![0;1]Nas follows.
Hi(w)=xi+f(PN
j=1ajiwj)
xi+yizi+f(PN
j=1ajiwj);w=(w1;;wN)T2K:
It is trivial to show that Cis an equilibrium of the GSCS model if and only if Cis a ﬁxed point of H. Furthermore, it is
easy to show that Hmaps Kinto itself. It follows from Lemma 2 that Hhas a ﬁxed point, denoted C=(C
1;;C
N)T.
This implies that Cis an equilibrium of the GSCS model, where CiC
iCi;1iN. By Lemma 4,
C
i>0;1iN.
The remaining thing to do is to show that Cis the unique ﬁxed point of H. On the contrary, suppose Hhas a ﬁxed
point other than C. Denote this equilibrium by C=(C
1;;C
N)T. Let

This contradicts the assumption that C

i0. Hence, Cis the unique ﬁxed point of H. The proof is complete.
3.4. The stability of the equilibrium
Theorem 2. The equilibrium Cof the GSCS model is stable with recpect to 
.
Proof. LetC(t)=(C1(t);C2(t);;CN(t))Tbe a solution to the GSCS model. By Lemma 4, there are t0>0 and
c>0 such that
min

Deﬁne a function Vas

It is easily veriﬁed that Vis positive deﬁnite with respect to C, i.e., (a) V(C(t))0, and (b) V(C(t))=0 if and only
ifC(t)=C. Next , let us show that D+V(C(t))0;tt0, where D+stands for the upper-right Dini derivative of V
along C(t). To this end, we need to show the following two claims.
Claim 1: D+Z(C(t))0 ifZ(C(t))1. Moreover, D+Z(C(t))<0 ifZ(C(t))>1.
Claim 2: D +z(C(t))0 ifz(C(t))1. Moreover, D+z(C(t))>0 ifz(C(t))<1. Here D+stands for the lower-right
Dini derivative.

k0=0;
where the second inequality follows from the concavity of f, and the third inequality follows from the monotonicity
off. This implies D+Z(C(t))0. As the ﬁrst inequality is strict if Z(C(t))>1, we get that D+Z(C(t))<0 if
Z(C(t))>1. Claim 1 is proven.
The argument for Claim 2 is analogous to that for Claim 1 and hence is omitted. Next, consider three possibilities.
Case 1: Z(C(t))<1. Then z(C(t))<1,V(C(t))=1 z(C(t)). Hence, D+V(C(t))= D+z(C(t))<0.
Case 2: z(C(t))>1. Then Z(C(t))>1,V(C(t))=Z(C(t)) 1. Hence, D+V(C(t))=D+Z(C(t))<0.
Case 3: Z(C(t))1,z(C(t))1. Then V(C(t))=Z(C(t)) z(C(t)),D+V(C(t))=D+Z(C(t)) D+z(C(t))0.
Moreover, the equality holds if and only if C(t)=C.
The theorem follows from the LaSalle Invariance Principle.
LetC(t) denote the expected fraction of compromised nodes in the cyber network at time t,Cthe expected
fraction of compromised nodes in the cyber network when the expected network state is C.

The following result is a corollary of Theorem 2.
Corollary 1. Consider the GSCS model (1). Then C (t)!Cas t!1 .
Obviously, Cis dependent upon the four technical levels, the interconnection network, and the attack and defense
schemes. We refer to the four technical levels and the interconnection network as parameters , because they are almost
ﬁxed. We refer to the attack and defense schemes as independent variables , because the attack scheme is ﬂexibly
choosable by the attacker, and the defense scheme is ﬂexibly choosable by the defender. Formally,
C=C(x;y;z;;;;; G):

3.5. The limit security of cyber networks
In practice, Ccan be estimated simply through sampling and averaging. This method for estimating Cis valu-
able, because it does not require the defender to know the attack and infection tecnical levels as well as the attack
scheme. Therefore, Ccan be used to evaluate the security of the cyber network. Below let us deﬁne a security metric
of cyber networks under APTs.
Deﬁnition 1. Given the four technical levels, the interconnected network, the attack scheme and the defense scheme,
thelimit security of the cyber network is deﬁned as
SL=1 C; (3)
This security metric of cyber networks is rational, because the higher the limit security, the securer the cyber
network would be. The limit security is dependent upon the four technical levels, the interconnection network, the
attack scheme and the defense scheme. Formally,
C=C(x;y;z;;;;; G):
4. The inﬂuence of some factors on the limit security of a cyber network
In this section, we theoretically investigate the inﬂuence of some factors, including the technical levels, the attack
and defense resources per unit time per node, and the addition of new edges to the interconnection network, on the
limit security of a cyber network. For this purpose, deﬁne an irreducible Metzler matrix as follows.

It follows from Lemma 3(a) that s(M)<0. This implies that Mis invertible. As Mis Metzler, irreducible and

Theorem 3. For the GSCS model (1), we have@C

where M 1is negative. As Gis strongly connected, ATCis positive. Hence,@C
@>0.
As a corollary of this theorem, the inﬂuence of the four technical levels on the limit security of a cyber network is
shown as follows.
Corollary 2. For the GSCS model (1), we have@SL
@<0,@SL
@<0,@SL
@>0,@SL
@>0.
This corollary manifests that the limit security of a cyber network goes up with the prevention and recovery
technical levels, and comes down with the attack and infection technical levels. These results accord with our intuition.
Hence, the defender must try his best to enhance the prevention and recovery technical levels.
4.2. The inﬂuence of the attack and defense resources per unit time per node
Theorem 4. For the GSCS model (1), we have@C
@xi>0,@C
@yi<0,@C
@zi<0,1iN.
The argument for the theorem is analogous to that for the previous theorem. As a corollary of this theorem, the
inﬂuence of the attack and defense resources per unit time per node on the limit security of a cyber network is shown
as follows.
Corollary 3. For the GSCS model (1), we have@SL
@xi<0,@SL
@yi>0,@SL
@zi>0,1iN.
This corollary demonstrates that the limit security of a cyber network rises with the resource per unit time used
for preventing or recovering a node, and falls with the resource per unit time used for attacking a node. Again, these
results are consistent with our intuition. As a consequence, the defender is suggested to conﬁgure more defense
resource.
11
4.3. The inﬂuence of the addition of new edges to the interconnection network
Theorem 5. For the GSCS model, we have@C
@ai j>0,1i;jN, i,j.
The argument for the theorem is analogous to that for Theorem 3. As a corollary of this theorem, the addition of
new edges to the interconnection network on the limit security of a cyber network is shown as follows.
Corollary 4. For the GSCS model (1), we have@SL
@ai j<0,1i;jN, i,j.
This corollary manifests that the limit security of a cyber network declines with the addition of new edges to the
interconnection network. Hence, a well-connected cyber network is more vulnerable to APTs. Therefore, the defender
is suggested to limit the number of connections in the interconnection network.
5. The inﬂuence of two other factors on the limit security of a cyber network
In this section, we experimentally examine the inﬂuence of two factors, the ratio of the prevention resource to
the recovery resource, and the defense resource per unit time with given ratio of the attack resource to the defense
resource, on the limit security of a cyber network. In the following experiments, the generic function in the GSCS
model is set to be f(x)=x
1+x, and the interconnection network takes value from a set of six non-isomorphic trees
shown in Fig. 2.

5.1. The inﬂuence of the ratio of the prevention resource to the recovery resource
For a GSCS model, the ratio of the prevention resource to the recovery resource is
rPR=jjyjj1
jjzjj1:
We examine the inﬂuence of rPRon the limit security of a cyber network through simulation experiments.
Experiment 1. Consider 504 GSCS models, where =0:05,=0:01,=1,=1, G varies from G 1to G 6,
jjxjj1=1,jjyjj1=r

z; (j) degree-last x, uniform y, degree-ﬁrst z; (k) degree-last x, degree-ﬁrst y, uniform z; (l) degree-last x, degree-ﬁrst
yandz. For each of the GSCS model, the limit security of the cyber network is shown shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen
that, with the increase of r PR, the limit security of a cyber network goes up ﬁrst but then it goes down. Moreover, the
limit security attains the maximum in the proximity of r PR=1.
Many similar experiments exhibit qualitatively similar phenomena. It is concluded that, with the increase of the
ratio of the prevention resource to the recovery resource, the limit security of a cyber network goes up ﬁrst but then it
goes down. Moreover, the limit security attains the maximum when the prevention resource is close to the recovery
resource. Hence, the defender is suggested to distribute the total defense resource equally to prevention and recovery.

5.2. The inﬂuence of defense resource per unit time given the ratio of the attack resource to the defense resource
For a GSCS model, the ratio of the attack resource to the defense resource is
rAD=jjxjj1
jjyjj1+jjzjj1:
Obviously, the limit security of a cyber network declines with rAD. A question arises naturally: given the ratio of the
attack resource to the defense resource, how about the impact of the defense resource on the limit security of a cyber
network? Now, let us answer the question through simulation experiments.
14
Experiment 2. Consider 504 GSCS models, where =0:1,=0:05,=0:5,=1, G varies from G 1to G 6,
rAD=r,jjyjj1=jjzjj1=s, s2f2;3;;10g,jjyjj1=s1, with (a) r =1

(f) r=2, uniform x, degree-ﬁrst yandz; (g) r =1
2, degree-ﬁrst x, uniform yandz; (h) r =1, degree-ﬁrst x, uniform y
andz; (i) r =2, degree-ﬁrst x, uniform yandz; (j) r =1
2, degree-ﬁrst x,yandz; (k) r =1, degree-ﬁrst x,yandz; (l)
r=2, degree-ﬁrst x,yandz. For each of the GSCS models, the limit security of the cyber network is shown in Fig. 4.
It can be seen that the limit security of a cyber network ascends with s.
Many similar experiments exhibit qualitatively similar phenomena. It is concluded that, given the ratio of the
attack resource to the defense resource, the limit security of a cyber network goes up with the defense resource. This
result sounds a good news to the defender. Indeed, conﬁguring more defense resource is always an e ective means of
protecting against APTs.

This paper is devoted to measuring the security of cyber networks under APTs. An APT-based cyber attack-
defense process has been modeled as a dynamical system, which is shown to exhibit the global stability. Thereby, the
limit security has been introduced as a new security metric of cyber networks. The inﬂuence of di erent factors on
the limit security has been expounded. On this basis, some means of defending against APTs are recommended.
There are lots of open problems about APTs. In the case that the attack scheme is available, the defender must
16
maximize the limit security over all possible defense schemes, so as to minimize the loss caused by APTs. When the
attack scheme is not avaliable, the defender should furher minimize this maximized limit security over all possible
attack schemes, so as to evaluate the worst-case security of the cyber network. In this work, the attack and defense
schemes are both assumed to be unvaried over time. In practice, the attacker may ﬂexibly alter the attack scheme to
chase the highest proﬁt, and the defender may ﬂexibly change the defense scheme to maximize the security of the
cyber network. In such scenarios, the evaluation of the security of cyber networks would involve optimal control
theory [44–46] or /and dynamic game theory [47, 48].

ABSTRACT  
Computing systems and mobile technologies have changed 
dramatically since the introduction of firewall technology in 1988. 
The internet has grown from a simple network of networks to a 
cyber and physical entity that encompasses the entire planet. Cyber -
physical systems(CPS) now control most of the day to day 
operations of human civilization from autonomous cars to nuclear 
energy plants. While phenomenal, this growth has created new 
security threats. These are threats that cannot be blocked by a 
firewall for they are not only cyber but cyber -physical. In light of 
these cyber -physical threats, this paper proposes a security measure 
that promises to enhance the security of cyber -physical systems. 
Using theoretical cyber, physical, and cyber -physical at tack 
scenarios, this paper highlights the need for additional monitoring 
of cyber -physical systems as an extra security measure. 
Additionally, we illustrate the efficiency of the proposed monitor 
using a Shannon entropy proof, and a multiple security domai n 
nondeducibility  (MSDND) proof.

1 Introduction  
In May of 2017, a ransomware attack held most o f the 
developed world hostage, c rippling healthcare systems, 
manufacturing systems , and multiple critical infrastructures across the globe. The British National Health Services was forced to limit 
health care to only emergency cases  [7]. If not for a timely kill 
switch, the attack could have brought forth catastrophic damage to 
nuclear plants, air transportation systems, and many other 
infrastructures. The Wannacry  [7] ransomware attack is a  recent 
example o f a now critical threat . A great many cyber and physical 
attacks keep cropping up all over the world, most notably; the Iran 
stuxnet attack  [4] , which, according to Iran’s civil defense agency, 
was still a threat in October of 2018  [18], the byzantine replay 
attack  [19], and the  Ukraine power grid attack that left more than 
230,000 people without electricity  [20]. [23] provides an extensive 
list of typical security threats that are facing smart -city CPS and 
detailed countermeasures available to defend against these.  
Because cybe r-physical systems (CPS), are physical entities with 
cyber functionality, traditional cybersecurity measures are simply 
not sufficient to mitigate the threat posed by this new wave of 
cyber -physical attacks  [1]. While traditional cyber attacks were 
easily deducible and susceptible to prevention by means of a 
firewall or antivirus software, it has been shown that recent attacks 
like the Iran Stuxnet attack could go undetected for long periods of 
time [5]. A search for a solution to these threats should, ther efore, 
focus on making the occurrence of such attacks almost impossible, 
and if the attacks remain possible, then they should at least be 
swiftly deducible.  
The protection of cyber -physical systems cannot depend 
on the effectiveness of a single detection m echanism  [5]. However, 
the majority of the proposed Cyber -physical security measures 
have centered around the notion of a single monitoring unit. The 
Shadow Security Unit(SSU)  [16] proposed by Cruz et al is a viable 
idea, but considering that the SSU is a single unit that employs only 
cybersecurity measures, a cyber attack that targets the central 
monitoring unit itself, if not detected early, could be fatal to the rest 
of the CPS. Scaglione, Peisert, and McParland acknowledge the 
need for both a centralize d and distributed monitor but the proposed 
monitor is only an algorithm  [14]. While it’s a great algorithm, it’s 
still a cyber measure which will inevitably be vulnerable to some 
cyber attack. The same could be said about the Intrusion Detection 
Systems(ID Ss) [15], that is, IDSs are also a single cyber measure. 
For an extensive look at the many cyber attacks, industry CPS 
models, and common cyber measure, we direct the reader to [19].  
Other than purely cyber measures, some scholars hav e 
proposed the use of  physics based measures to detect attacks , but ∗Article Title Footnote needs to be captured as Title Note

 these very rarely provide ways to mitigate the attacks or prevent 
them in the first place  [21]. The primary idea o f those methods is 
that physical properties of the system models  can be used to detect 
attacks.  Their paper presents a detailed survey of recent physics -
based attack detection schemes in CPS models. Our research 
proposes the addition of a hybrid monitor spread over virtual nodes 
with randomized features. This addition to a CPS would provide a 
much -needed auxiliary layer of security and also enhance attack 
deductibility.  
This paper is arranged as follows; Section 2 introduces 
the tools used in testing the viability of the proposed hybrid monitor 
as a security measure for CPS. Section 3 gives a comprehensive 
look at the hybrid monitor, listing its features and the reasoning 
behind each feature. Section 4 explain s the methodology used to 
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the hybrid monitor. 
Section 5 presents the test sce narios  and proofs . Section 6  wraps up 
with a short conclusion.  
2 Background  
This research employs the Future Renewable Electric 
Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM)  [2] System as a 
model CPS. Shannon entropy  [8] is used as a tool to test the 
effectiveness of the monitor as a security measure. The multiple 
security domain nondeducibility(MSDND)  [1] is used as a tool to 
test the eff ectiveness of the monitor in detecting attacks.  
 The FREEDM system center is a  engineering research 
center funded by the National Science Foundation and spanning 
number of universities including but not limited to North Carolina 
State University, Missouri University of Science and Technology  
and Florida State University. The research center developed an 
energy management and distribution smart grid system located at 
the North Carolina State University that is also referred to as 
FREEDM  [2]. The heart of this energy system is the Distributed 
Grid Intelligence  (DGI)  [2], an intelligent algorithm that 
implements energy management and distribution using modular 
adapters to interact with devices in a smart grid over different 
interfaces. In this paper , the FREEDM system is employed as a test 
subject for the implementation of the hybrid monitor proposed by 
this research.  
The MSDND model is a security model that tests the 
integrity and confidentiality of a cyber -physical architecture. The 
MSDND model uses logic proofs to test information flow security; 
that is, how information moves among user groups within the 
security dom ains (SDs) that make up the system  [1]. Howser and 
Mcmillin show that maintaining information flow security in CPS 
is challenging because the flow is irrevocably linked among the 
CPS’ cyber and physical units  [1]. Therefore, the MSDND model 
is employed to account for both cyber and physical information 
flow paths. The model defines two system properties namely: 
MSDND secure and notMSDND secure  [1]. An MSDND secure system implies that for information flowing from entity A to entity 
B, entity B cannot deduce whether the information is valid or 
erroneous. This also means while an MSDND secure system is 
desirable if the goal is to maint ain confidentiality, it can  be an 
indicator of the possibility of an attack going undetected. A 
notMSDND secure system implies t he alternative, that is, entity B 
can evaluate the correctness of information obtained from entity A. 
Therefore, in the event of an attack, Howser, and McMillin shows 
that a notMSDND secure system could easily detect the occurrence 
of an attack  [1]. Thudim ila and McMillin demonstrate the 
superiority of MSDND over traditional electronic and 
cryptographic solutions  [3] when applied to detection of attacks in 
Automatic Dependent Surveillance -Broadcast(ADS -B) air traffic 
surveillance system  [3]. For this resear ch, MSDND is used to 
analyze whether a CPS with a hybrid monitor in place would 
deduce the occurrence of an attack.  
Phan  et al introduce the idea of using information flow -
metrics like Shannon entropy to measu re information leakage in 
CPS programs  [9]. Li uses Shannon Entropy to break down the 
physical dynamics of CPS and goes on to show the negative 
entropy that communication adds to the general entropy of a CPS  
[10]. In this text, Shannon Entropy is used to i llustrate the decrease 
in the possibility of an attack in a CPS after the introduction of a 
hybrid monitor. This demonstrates the value of adding a  hybrid  
monitor to CPS architectures as an extra security measure.  
Shannon entropy is an information theory c oncept 
derived from the general idea of information entropy that was 
developed and introduced by Claude Shannon  [8]. Entropy is 
basically a measure of uncertainty in a communication system 
where a low entropy value implies minimal uncertainty and a high 
entropy implies the contrary. Shannon entropy defines entropy ( H) 
as: 
 
Where I is the information content o f the discrete random 
variable X. Therefore we can further define  E[I(X)]  in terms of th e 
probability mass function of X : i.e, 
 
The generally definition of entropy H then comes to:  
 
3 The Hybrid Monitor  

Introduction of a Hybrid Monitor to Cyber -Physical 
Systems  CPS-SPC’19, Nov, 2019, London, UK  
 
 To better protect cyber -physical systems, this research 
proposes the addition of a monitor. Many other researchers have 
explored the use of hybrid monitoring to ensure safety or/and 
security in CPSs. Li et al.  propose extended hybrid automata 
modeling for vehicular CPSs as a safety and control measure  [11]. 
Mao and Chen also introduce a runtime hybrid automaton 
monitoring framework for the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise 
Control Systems(CA CC) [12]. This research borrows the idea of 
hybrid monitoring but with randomization as an additional feature. 
The addition of randomization in information flow paths’ 
generation increases the system’s entropy and in turn, reduces the 
chances of a successf ul attack in a generic CPS. That is because a 
higher number of information flow paths increases the number of 
points the attacker has to corrupt to remain undetected. Below is a 
detailed break down of this hybrid monitor’s features;  
▪ The monitor is hybrid, that is , both virtual and physical, 
central and decentralized. The monitor would have both 
a virtual component and physical component. The virtual 
components would be implemented as a hidden 
algorithm in every Supervisory control and data 
acquisiti on unit (SCADA) in the CPS. The physical 
component of the monitor would be a physical unit 
independent of the entire CPS and running a monitoring 
algorithm whose function is to oversee the operations of 
the monitor’s virtual components. The physical 
compo nent is, therefore, a central unit and the virtual 
components are the decentralized units.  
▪ The monitor should be intelligent enough to generate 
physical invariants for every information flow path in the 
CPS. An invariant is simply a logical assertion that 
should always be true throughout an execution cycle. 
Therefore  physical invariants are logical properties of a 
CPS that cannot be transformed by cyber entities and 
should always be held true. Having physical invariants 
makes the CPS vastly more secure bec ause they are 
secure from being corrupted by cyber attacks. With that 
in mind, the hybrid monitor uses generated physical 
invariants as a validator of the information received from 
other system modules. The automated generation of 
physical invariant using machine learning, deep learning 
or linear regression is also a viable research area. The 
automation of invariant generation is explored further by 
Cruz  et al [16].  
▪ The virtual components of the monitors would 
continuously generate a randomly increasing num ber of 
paths for the flow of information between any two CPS 
entities. The physical monitor should also generate a 
randomly increasing number of virtual paths as a 
compliment to a physical path for the flow of information 
between any two virtual components  of the monitor.  ▪ All paths generated by the monitor should be independent 
of each other. This ensures that all the randomly 
generated paths cannot be collectively corrupted by an 
attacker.  
▪ To reduce the information flow overhead, information 
sent through t he monitors should be sent through a 
randomly chosen path among the generated paths and 
then white noise should be transmitted on the rest of the 
paths.  
▪ The monitor should have a routing algorithm that can be 
employed if the monitor detects a failure or co rruption at 
any of the CPS’ entities.  
▪ Communication between the virtual and physical 
monitor should be done on an entirely different network 
than that used by the rest of the cyber -physical system.  
Note that this hybrid monitor is only a theoretical idea but the exact 
physical realization  should at the very least aim to implement the 
above mentioned features.  
4 Methodology  
This research uses two methods to highlight the 
significance of introducing a hybrid monitor to a CPS .  
4.1 Method 1  
The research employs attack scenarios to examine the 
security of a CPS with and without the hybrid monitor. There are 
three attack scenarios, that is; A purely cyber attack like a 
ransomware on a CPS, a completely phy sical attack like the 
attacker inflicting physical damage to the CPS by, for example, 
cutting wires and a cyber -physical attack like the Iran Stuxnet 
attack expounded upon in Kushner’s  [4] and Karnouskos’  [5] work.  
4.2 Method 2  
In the second method, the research uses two proof models 
i.e Shannon entropy and MSDND to show that the addition of a 
hybrid monitor makes a CPS less susceptible to an undetected 
attack and much more effective at deducing attacks when they do 
occur.  
5 Research Results  
This section details the three attack scenarios, their 
respective results, the Shannon entropy proof, and MSDND proof.  
5.1 Cyber Attack scenario  
As mentioned in the background, the FREEDM system is 
controlled by a distributed algorithm called the DGI. The DGI is 
set up  to run on multiple nodes spread out over a network. It 
CPS-SPC’19, Nov, 2019, London, UK  J. Ceasar  Aguma  et al.  
 
 
 provides an interface for energy management applications to 
communicate with physical power devices.  
 
Figure 1:  The DGI under a WannaCry attack  
Let us assume that a DGI node is being held hostage by 
the wannaCry ransomware  (figure 1). This kind of attack is rather 
easy to detect because ransomware attacks normally make the user 
aware that the attack is in progress. Therefore, for this scenario, 
attack d eductibility is not important. But because the attacker is 
holding a node hostage, all information flowing through this node 
could be infected by the attacker. This could give the attacker 
further access to other nodes since all nodes of the DGI share stat e 
information. At this point, it’s clear that the entire DGI could be 
held hostage. Since the DGI manages the entire FREEDM smart 
grid system, the entire CPS would be either rendered useless or 
could be left vulnerable to more damaging attacks.  
Now let’s c onsider a scenario where a hybrid monitor 
was in place with virtual units running alongside every DGI node 
and a physical unit to oversee the virtual units. Because all traffic 
that goes through a node is verified by the monitor and subjected to 
physical i nvariants generated by the monitor, it would be easy for 
the monitor to flag the presence of the ransomware. Since the 
monitor has information flow routing capabilities, all state 
information from other nodes would be safely rerouted through 
other nodes. W hile the infected node would not be saved, the rest 
of the DGI would continue to function without threat.  
5.2 Physical  Attack scenario  
For this scenario, we assume that an attacker has inflicted 
physical damage to the CPS without using cyber means. The 
damage could be as simple as cutting an Ethernet  cord or breaking 
a sensor. The detection and solution for such an attack are also 
rather simple. However, if the CPS is a critical infrastructure like a 
nuclear reactor that needs to continuously keep some func tions 
fully operational then even this simple attack could prove fatal. 
With a monitor in place, any failure in the CPS would quickly be 
detected. The monitor, through information flow rerouting, would go even further to keep critical functions running whi le the damage 
gets fixed.  
5.3 Cyber -physical  Attack scenario  
The third and last scenario assumes that a microcontroller 
in FREEDM system is infected by Stuxnet  (figure 2) . Erroneous 
Information from this microcontroller could cause catastrophic 
damage to the smart grid. In this case, deducing the presence of the 
Stuxnet and reducing the damage to the smart grid are both 
necessary . 
 Figure 2 : The DGI under a Stuxnet attack  
From the Iran attack, it’s clear that the Stuxnet could go 
unnoticed for a long time if no extra security measure is put in 
place. Although, if the FREEDM system had a hybrid monitor, the 
Stuxnet would be detected because all information from the 
microcontroller would have to be verified by the monitor. Since the 
monitor has physical invariants to prove the correctness of 
information from this microcontroller, any discrepancies in the 
information generated by the Stuxnet would be caught. On 
detection, information flow would then be routed through other 
nodes and fu rther infection would be avoided. The Stuxnet would 
have to infect all random paths used by the hybrid monitor to avoid 
detection. The Shannon Entropy proof below shows that there is a 
very small possibility of the Stuxnet or attacker infecting all of the 
hybrid monitor’s random paths.  
5.4 MSDND proof  
For this proof, let’s look at the cyber -physical Stuxnet 
attack shown above. More specifically, the information path 
between the infected microcontroller and the DGI node process 
running on the computer withou t the monitor.

node and SDmic for the microcontroller with valuation functions 
Vnode and Vmic respectively. Then consider a scenario where 
arbitrary information (φ) is sent from the infected microcontroller 
to the DGI n ode process. If the DGI node process and 
microcontroller are at the same level of security, then the DGI node 
process will trust that information from the infected microcontroller 
to be valid. Since the information can be either true or false, the 
first co ndition; i.e,.. (SDφmic, SD¬φmic ) for MSDND is met  [1]. 
This is derived from the fact that if φ is true then SDφmic is true or 
if φ is false then SD¬φmic is true hence the xor statement is always 
true. 
The second condition is also satisfied from the 
assum ption that the two domains are at the same security level  [1]. 
Therefore, the DGI node process believes and trusts the infected 
microcontroller. This means the DGI node process has no valuation 
function to prove the validity of φ  [1]. The absence of this v aluation 
function (Vφnode) leaves the system in an MSDND secure system  
[1]. This is the MSDND secure evaluation  shown in figure 4.  
Figure 4 : MSDND evaluation for the DGI with a monitor  
The implication of this MSDND evaluation is that if the 
infected microcontroller sent false information to the DGI node 
process, there would be no way of evaluating that the information is false. Therefore the Stux net would go undetected. Knowin  this, 
let us take a look at a scenario with the monitor in place.  
The difference in this scenario is the presence of a 
monitor that is equipped with physical invariants. Using a physical 
invariant, the monitor can evaluate the validity of φ. With this, the 
monitor c an also determine the state of the microcontroller with 
respect to the validity of φ; i.e,.. There exist a valuation Vφmon 
leaving the state SDφmic deducible  [1]. Hence  the notMSDND 
secure evaluation shown in figure 4.  
The proof shows that in the event of a cyber -physical 
attack like the Stuxnet attack, the presence of a monitor would 
render the attack deducible. For the attack to go undetected with a 
monitor in place, the attacker would have to infect every single 
monitor node, both virtual and physical. T he next Shannon entropy 
proof will show that the possibility of compromising all the monitor 
nodes without being detected is rather minimal.  
5.5 Shannon Entropy proof  
The proof considers two scenarios where the attacker is 
attempting to infect the informat ion flow between the DGI node 
process and the microcontroller.   
First, let us take a look at the entropy of the setup without 
the monitor. There are two possible information flow events x _1 
and x _2 that the attack could target. With a sample space = 2, the  
probability of the attacker successfully infecting information flow 
between the DGI node process and microcontroller is ½. The 
entropy evaluation for this scenario is shown below.  
Figure 5 : Shannon Entropy evaluation for the DGI with out a 
monitor  

CPS-SPC’19, Nov, 2019, London, UK  J. Ceasar  Aguma  et al.  
 
 
 With a monitor in place, the sample space grows to (2n + 
2), making the probability of successfully corrupting one path come 
to 1/[2(n + 1)]. Here is the entropy evaluation;   
Figure 6 : Shannon Entropy evaluation for the DGI with  a 
monitor  
The p roof shows us that the entropy increases with the 
increase in the size of n paths. From the attacker’s point of view, 
the uncertainty increases with increasing size of n paths. Therefore 
as the size of n increases, it becomes much harder for the attacker 
to launch a successful attack on the CPS. By adding the hybrid 
monitor, the system is not fully secure from an attack but the 
possibility of a successful attack is vastly smaller.  
6 Conclusion  
After 2017’s Ransomware attack  [17], the world can not 
ignore the threat posed by the possibility of using attacks on cyber -
physical systems as a tool for terrorism and cyber warfare. The 
increased occurrence of cyber -physical systems attacks is surely an 
indicator that traditional cybersecurity measures are i nsufficient at 
prevention and detection of these attacks. The world needs to start 
considering alternative or improved security measures. The 
combination of an intelligent, randomized physical monitor with 
existing virtual cyber measures to create a hybrid  monitor is a good 
place to start. While, the hybrid monitor is not a foolproof solution 
to cyber -physical attacks, it could well be the best solution yet. 
Future research in this area should focus on physical 
implementation of the hybrid monitor and preve ntion of attacks 
targeting the hybrid monitor itself. This hybrid monitor could be 
the great leap towards fully securing an important and 
nonexpendable entity of smart living that is cyber -physical systems.

CPES-QSM: A Quantitative Method Towards the
Secure Operation of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems
Juan Ospina, Member, IEEE, Venkatesh Venkataramanan, Member, IEEE ,

Abstract —Power systems are evolving into cyber-physical en-
ergy systems (CPES) mainly due to the integration of modern
communication and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. CPES se-
curity evaluation is challenging since the physical and cyber
layers are often not considered holistically. Existing literature
focuses on only optimizing the operation of either the physical
or cyber layer while ignoring the interactions between them.
This paper proposes a metric, the Cyber-Physical Energy System
Quantitative Security Metric (CPES-QSM), that quantiﬁes the
interaction between the cyber and physical layers across three
domains: electrical, cyber-risk, and network topology. A method
for incorporating the proposed cyber-metric into operational
decisions is also proposed by formulating a cyber-constrained
AC optimal power ﬂow (C-ACOPF) that considers the status of
all the CPES layers. The C-ACOPF considers the vulnerabilities
of physical and cyber networks by incorporating factors such
as voltage stability, contingencies, graph-theory, and IoT cyber
risks, while using a multi-criteria decision-making technique.
Simulation studies are conducted using standard IEEE test
systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed metric and
the C-ACOPF formulation.

I. I NTRODUCTION
THE modernization and decentralization of electric power
systems (EPS) are being facilitated by the integration
of distributed energy resources (DERs) and the wide-scale
deployment of internet-of-things (IoT) devices and information
and communication technologies (ICTs). However, this mod-
ernization and transformation from old passive EPS to cyber-
physical energy systems (CPES) have their disadvantages.
Progressively, CPES are becoming more challenging to secure
due to the incorporation of IoT/ICT devices that introduce
cyber vulnerabilities to physical systems, thus creating attack
vectors not previously considered in traditional power system
operations [1].Recent attack incidents such as BlackEnergy, CrashOver-
ride, and Triton illustrate the growing threat of vulnerabilities
in the IoT/ICT infrastructure of power systems [2], [3]. One
prominent example of an attack incident affecting the power
grid is the 2015 Ukraine cyber-attack [4]. In this case, ad-
versaries were able to trip important circuit breakers causing
a blackout that affected almost 225,000 customers. Other
examples of potential threats to EPS are explored in [5], [6],
where authors demonstrated how attackers can compromise
phasor measurement units (PMUs) by spooﬁng GPS signals
via the use of open-source exploitation methods and open-
source intelligence (OSINT) techniques.
Even though the electricity sector has matured in the deploy-
ment of protection systems, researchers and stakeholders still
struggle when quantifying the cybersecurity status and vulner-
abilities of systems operating in a CPES [7]. Conventionally,
metrics exist to quantify either the cyber or the physical
domain independently. For instance in the cyber domain, Infor-
mation Technology (IT) systems metrics such as the Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) [8] exist, which only
relies on IT experts’ opinions to grade vulnerabilities based
on several factors, such as attack vector and attack complexity.
While CVSS is useful for analyzing vulnerabilities for IT sys-
tems, the framework is insufﬁcient when considering critical
infrastructure systems. Trying to address these issues, efforts
such as the CERT Resilience Management Model [9], the
MITRE’s Cyber Resilience Engineering Framework (CREF)
[10], and the Infrastructure Resilience Analysis Methodology
(IRAM) [4], have been proposed but fail to provide sufﬁciently
useful information to system operators due to not having direct
interpretations related to the operation of CPES.
While there are metrics that compute individual physical and
cyber resiliency factors, there is a lack of metrics designed
to study cyber-physical security rigorously in an integrated
manner. Also, many of the metrics proposed in the literature
are an aggregation of existing metrics, that need domain
specialists to interpret them. That is why authors have focused
on addressing this lack of existing metrics by proposing
different resiliency metrics and methods specially tailored for
small-scale CPES. An example is presented in [11], where
authors propose resiliency metrics that capture the level of
preparedness of a distribution system to resist extreme adverse
conditions. In [12], authors propose a stochastic security-
oriented risk management technique devised to estimate cyber-
physical security indices tailored to measure the security level
of a cyber-physical system (CPS).
The papers presented in [13] and [14] are the ones that are
closer to the idea proposed in this paper, since the metrics and
methods proposed in these papers follow a similar formulation
based on a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach.
In these papers, the authors explore the concept of combining
different factors, coming from different domains such as
the physical, cyber, and device-management domains, using
Choquet Integrals (CI) to compute an overall resiliency score
of the system. The main differences between our proposed
approach and the methods presented in these papers are related
to the: (a)factors considered (different physical, graph-theory,
and cyber factors), (b)individual scoring metric for each

node/bus in the CPES (thus improving visibility and human-
in-the-loop (HiTL) processes), and (c)the utilization of the
proposed cyber-metric as a deciding factor to improve not only
the resilience but the overall cyber-physical security state of
AC optimal power ﬂow (ACOPF) solutions for CPES.
Another major contribution of this paper is related to the
utilization of the proposed cyber-metric as a factor that directly
alters the traditional ACOPF solutions of a CPES based on the
real-time cybersecurity status of the system, and thus, in a way
merging the physical and the cyber domains. A limited number
of papers have explored the idea of modifying the ACOPF
formulation so that it can integrate the status of the cyber layer
of the CPES. One example is the paper presented in [15],
where authors propose a cyber-constrained OPF model for
the emergency response of smart grids. The proposed model
considers both the physical and cyber network by adding
cyber-related constraints to the traditional ACOPF but has the
disadvantage of being a ‘black-and-white’ mapping process
that assumes the total loss of control of a physical bus mapped
to a ‘cyber-blind’ cyber node (cyber-blind meaning a cyber
node that becomes invisible due to failing). Another similar
paper is the one presented in [16], where authors develop a
multi-agent-based algorithm designed to optimize the power
ﬂow of a CPES based on power ﬂow constraints derived
from ‘community resilience’ factors such as levels of emotion,
empathy, cooperation, and physical health of consumers. The
community and cyber-layer factors are measured based on
social media sentiment analysis and other social and human
factors related to cognitive science and psychology.
A. Contributions
Contrasting from the papers examined, this paper aims
to address the speciﬁc problem of quantitatively measuring
the real-time cyber-physical security of a CPES considering
factors that affect both its physical and cyber domains by
proposing a novel cyber-metric. It intends to provide an
intuitive and easy-to-understand metric that can be used for
HiTL operations and can directly reﬂect the cyber-physical
status of the CPES into the ACOPF solutions so that the
optimization can be performed not only based on the physicalstatus of the system but considering its current cyber status.
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
A quantitative cyber-physical security metric for CPES is
proposed. The Cyber-Physical Energy System Quantita-
tive Security Metric (CPES-QSM) is designed to quantify
the current cyber-physical status of every IoT-connected
node in a CPES by combining factors from the electrical,
IT, and graph-theory domains using an MCDM approach.
The metric provides an easy-to-interpret way to evaluate
the current state of the CPES.
A cyber-constrained ACOPF formulation that takes into
account not only the physical state of the system but
also considers the current status of its cyber domain,
using the proposed CPES-QSM as a proxy, is proposed.
The formulation is intended to restrict the OPF solution
space based on the current cyber status of nodes in
the system, which can make them ‘unreliable’ based on
vulnerabilities or modeled attack-graphs threats targeting
IoT devices deployed in the respective nodes of the CPES.
Experimental case studies are investigated using standard
IEEE test systems to demonstrate the usefulness of the
proposed cyber-metric and validate the utilization of
the cyber-constrained ACOPF formulation for achieving
more secure OPF solutions (i.e., considering both the
physical and cyber status). The results show how the pro-
posed formulation improves the security and stability of
the system when a cyberattack compromises vulnerable
nodes.
Fig. 1 depicts the overall framework for the use of the pro-
posed CPES-QSM in conjunction with the cyber-constrained
ACOPF formulation with the objective of reaching a more
secure operating state by adjusting the system’s dispatch. The
ﬁgure illustrates how different factors coming from the cyber,
physical, and graph environments are combined into a single
quantitative score that is used to improve system’s operation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II presents the proposed quantitative cyber-physical security
metric, CPES-QSM. Section III focuses on presenting the
proposed cyber-constrained ACOPF formulation that makes
use of the CPES-QSM as a proxy for constraining the optimal
solutions based on the cyber factors of the CPES. Section IV
4
presents the experimental setup and case studies performed to
evaluate the utility of the proposed cyber-metric and demon-
strate its effectiveness for constraining the traditional ACOPF.
Finally, Section V presents conclusions and future work.
II. CPES-QSM C OMPUTATION & F ACTORS
This section presents the proposed quantitative cyber-
physical metric, CPES-QSM, that is designed to provide a
real-time numerical value to the cyber and physical status of an
operating CPES. The CPES-QSM cyber-metric provides, via
an easy-to-interpret score, operating observability of individual
components and/or nodes in a CPES that can be used and
interpreted by both human operators and control systems for
improving the secure and resilient operation of CPES.
Before the computation of the CPES-QSM is presented,
we need to examine the different factors that affect the ﬁnal
computation of the score. Since our focus is towards CPES,
the factors considered cover the following three main domains:
(1)Electrical , (2) IT, and (3) Graph theory-based . Within
these domains, factors are also classiﬁed according to the
environment they affect. The environments being considered
are: (1) Physical , (2) Cyber , and (3) Network . Each factor,
explained in the next subsections, has been categorized using
one domain and one environment. Additional details about
each factor are presented in Table I using a similar format as
the one presented by EPRI in [17], [18]. It is important to note
that the cyber-metric framework presented in this paper is not
tied to the speciﬁc factors presented throughout the manuscript
and the user/operator has the liberty to choose the factors that
he/she thinks better characterizes the physical/cyber/network
system being analyzed.
A. Electrical Domain Factors
TheElectrical Domain factors encompass all factors directly
related to the electrical or physical operation of the CPES.
1) Contingency Ranking Performance Index (CRPI): This
factor calculates a contingency performance index, using the
fast decoupled power ﬂow (FDPF) 1P1Q contingency ranking
method [19], that provides information about the most suscep-
tible lines and buses in a CPES. The speciﬁc details for the
CRPI factor are shown in Table I. The goal of this factor is
to calculate the performance index (PI) that tells which lines
are most susceptible to overload. Note that Target represents
the objective value of the factor, i.e., the best value is 0while
the worst is 1(CRPI values are scaled to the [0-1] range).
The process for computing the CRPI is based on the process
presented in [19]. A PI value is assigned to each line outage
scenario that can occur in a system. The deﬁnition of the PI

nPIproduces a small PIvalue (i.e.,0) if all line ﬂows
are within the limit. On the other hand, if one or more lines
are overloaded, the PIvalue produced will be large. For our
test cases,nPI= 2 is used. The use of the PIvalue helps
us to quickly determine which lines of the system will have
a higher impact when taken out, thus which buses are more
important in terms of physical contingency security. Using
thesePIvalues, a table for each line in the network can be
created and sorted from largest to smallest. The values at the
top of the list represent the lines that are most important in
the contingency ranking; thus they are assigned a higher value.
The complete process for computing the CRPI value for each
bus in the system is shown in Fig. 2.
As seen in Fig. 2, the process for calculating the PIvalues
for each line in the system starts by obtaining the current
status of the system via SE, PF, and/or real-time measurements
from in-ﬁeld IoT devices. Then, using these values alongside
the deﬁned constants of the process (i.e., MW limits for lines
andnPI), the loop in charge of computing the individual PI
value for each line in the system is executed. In this loop, line
(i) is ﬁrst removed from the network (outage scenario); then
an FDPF using the 1P1Q method is performed in order to
estimate the ‘new’ power ﬂows of the system [19]. The use of
the1P1Q method, instead of a traditional full ACPF, allows
the fast execution of a relatively accurate ACPF without the
need of an exact result and multiple iterations, thus reducing
the computational complexity and allowing its use in both
transmission and distribution systems. After the FDPF is
performed, the ‘new’ line ﬂows are computed and used to
calculate the corresponding PIvalue for line iusing Eq. (1).
Finally, the PIvalue is added to a table or list which will be
sorted at the end of the process. After all lines are processed,
the ﬁnal list is sorted from largest to smallest, and the PI
value for the line ia;bconnecting buses aandbis assigned to
busesaandb. If a bus is connected to more than one line, the
maximumPIof all the lines connected to the bus is selected
as the CRPI value for the bus.
2) Voltage Deviation Index (VDI): This factor calculates
the voltage deviation for each bus in the CPES from the
nominal 1.0 pu. Similar to CRPI, VDI is considered to be
in the Electrical domain and the Physical environment. The

formula to compute the VDI factor is:
VDIk=j1:0 Vmag
k(in pu )j (2)
whereVmag
k(in pu )is the voltage magnitude measured (in pu)
at buskin the system. The target of the value is 0 since this
would mean the bus is exactly at the 1.0 nominal value. This is
an easy-to-calculate factor that provides important information
related to how far the voltage in a bus is from the nominal
1.0 pu. The speciﬁc details for this factor are shown in Table
I. The goal of this factor is to calculate the voltage deviation
(in pu) of a node/bus.
3) Voltage Collapse Prediction Index (VCPI): This factor
calculates a predicted voltage collapse index, which is de-
signed to determine how close a bus is to voltage collapse.
This factor is based on the technique proposed in [20], which is
an online technique designed to predict voltage collapse. This
factor makes use of voltage magnitudes and voltage angles
measured at the respective buses together with the network
admittance matrix of the system in order to estimate how
close a bus is to voltage collapse when compared to other
buses in the system. The method is considered computationally
efﬁcient for real-time prediction of voltage collapse in EPS
[20] since it only needs real-time voltage measurements for
its computation. The speciﬁc details for the VCPI factor are
shown in Table I. The goal of this factor is to estimate how
close the bus is to voltage collapse and the measurements
used are the voltage phasors at sending & receiving buses,
and admittance matrix. The VCPI factor for bus k(receiving
bus) is calculated with Eq. (3).

whereVmis the voltage phasor at bus m(sending bus), Ykm
is the admittance between buses kandm, andYkjis the
admittance between bus kandj. The VCPI factor is computed
for each bus in the system.4) Simpliﬁed Voltage Stability Index (SVSI): This factor
calculates a simpliﬁed voltage stability index (SVSI) based on
the voltage measurements of the system and load ﬂow results.
This factor is based on the indicator presented in [21], and
the relative electrical distance (RED) concept detailed in [22].
This factor has a similar, but not equal, objective as the VCPI
factor presented previously as it is designed to determine how
stable a bus in the system is, in terms of voltage collapse.
However, the main difference with VCPI is its ability to
estimate the voltage stability of a bus based on the RED to the
nearest generation bus. In other words, it uses the difference in
voltage between the nearest generation bus and the analyzed
bus while comparing them to the maximum voltage change
in the system (measured considering the substation as the bus
with the maximum voltage value). In essence, the estimation
of the voltage stability, using this factor, is directly related
to how well the generation resources can modify and adjust
the voltage at the respective bus. The inputs to compute this
factor are: the voltage phasors (voltage magnitude and angle)
from the closest generator ( g), substation ( m), and receiving
(k) buses. The admittance matrix is also needed to ﬁnd the
nearest generator to bus k, which in turn, can be determined
using the RED. The details for the SVSI factor are shown in
Table I. The SVSI factor for node kcan be computed using:
SVSIk=Vk
Vk(5)
whereVkis the voltage phasor at bus k, i.e., our analyzed
bus, andis a correction factor that computes the highest
difference of voltage magnitudes between any two buses in
the system (in the equation, buses mandl). The term is
computed using:
= 1 
max(jVmj jVlj)2
(6)
Finally, the Vkcan be estimated using:
Vk=jVg Vkj (7)
whereVgis the voltage phasor of the nearest generator bus
(at busg) to busk. This value is computed using the RED
concept that indicates the relative distance of each load bus to
all the generator buses in the system [22], [23].

Thetopol ogyoftheoverallCPES isassumed sothatthephys i-

each node inthephys ical-layer ofthesystemismapped one-

Itisimportant toremark that theassump tion of‘isomor-

sidered when mapping thecyberelements with power sys-
tems components. This assump tion ensures that each phys i-

the analyzed node on the overall graph. Itquan tiﬁesthenum-

(s;t)is the total number of shortest paths between nodes s

then(s;tjv) = 0 [24].

higher value of CC indicates higher centrality [25].
3) Edge Betweenness Centrality (EBC): This factor es-
timates the importance of the edges/lines connected to the
analyzed node. The EBC is a factor very similar to BC but
calculated for the edges of the graph. The EBC of an edge e
can be calculated as the sum of the fraction of all-pairs shortest

C. Cyber Domain Factors
The Cyber Domain factors encompass all factors that are
directly related to the cyber-layer structure and operation of the
CPES. These factors provide a quantitative way of factoring
cybersecurity risks that IoT systems introduce into EPS. The
processes followed to calculate the quantitative cyber risk base
model (QCR-B) factor or the quantitative cyber risk attack
graph-based model (QCR-A) factor are inspired from the cyber
risk assessment methodology presented in [26]. The CVSS
v3.1 is used as the scoring system that quantiﬁes the cyber risk
of the vulnerabilities that exist in the system [27]. Essentially,
it estimates the difﬁculty of vulnerability exploitation for each
electronic device that exists in a particular node of the cyber-
layer of the CPES. The general cyber risk formula used for
both QCR-A and QCR-B is QCRB=A=PI, whereQCR
is the risk, Pis the probability, and Iis the impact. The
metric values shown in Table II are used to calculate the P
variable according to its corresponding calculation process.
More details regarding these metrics are given in [28].

1) Quantitative Cyber Risk Base Model (QCR-B): This
factor estimates the cyber risk of a cyber node based on CVSS
v3.1 and the vulnerabilities identiﬁed in the device that exists
in that particular node. This is designed to be the base model of
the QCR factor that should be used at nodes that are composed
of only one IoT device or access point. The probability Pin
the risk formulation calculation can be computed as:
P=AVACUIPR (12)
The impact Iof the risk formula is computed using the
graph-theory factors presented in the previous subsection times
the total bulk impact on the system.
I= (BC+CC+EBC )P%
g=l(13)
whereP%
g=lis the generation or load percentage of the total
generation or load in the system. The risk assessment model
that describes this calculation process is presented in Fig. 4. As
seen in this ﬁgure, this factor estimates what is the probability
or likelihood a vulnerability is exploited on the cyber-physical
assets, thus causing an impact on the system. Nodes with high
Pvalues (very easy to compromise) and generating/consuming
a high percentage of power, with respect to the total load in
the system (high Ivalues), are the nodes that are considered
more dangerous to the cyber-secure operation of the system.
2) Quantitative Cyber Risk Attack Graph-based Model
(QCR-A): This factor estimates the cyber risk of a cyber
node based on CVSS v3.1 and the vulnerabilities identiﬁed
in multiple IoT devices that exist in that particular node. This
is designed to be the model that should be used at nodes that
are composed of multiple electronic devices or access points
where serial andparallel attack graphs can be modeled. Fig. 5
shows the QCR-A risk assessment process, which differs from
the QCR-B process presented previously due to the inclusion
of attack graphs that model the path followed by threats that
compromise the devices that make up the cyber node.
The probability Pin the risk formulation calculation for
this version of the factor needs to consider the attack graph
method followed to compromise the vulnerabilities in the
corresponding devices. Depending on the movement method
of the threat, i.e., serial or parallel, the leading probability

Pis calculated differently. The ‘leading probability’ term is
deﬁned as the multiplication of all the probabilities leading to
the targeted device. The probability Pfor a serial movement
is calculated by multiplying the leading probabilities with the
interim probability at the last device, where the interim prob-
ability is deﬁned as the probability of the device calculated
from the CVSS scores of the device’s vulnerabilities. The

The impact Iof QCR-A can be estimated using the same
approach used by the QCR-B factor, i.e., Eq. (13). In a real-
time application, both of these factors will be mainly affected
by the impact (I), which changes according to the percentage
of generation or load (at the speciﬁc time) with respect to the
total load in the system. The speciﬁc details for these factors
are shown in Table I.
D. Cyber-Physical Energy System Quantitative Security Met-
ric (CPES-QSM) Computation
After the required factors are computed, they are combined
using an MCDM approach called the Choquet Integral (CI)
[29]. The main advantage of using the CI for aggregating
the factors is that it allows the aggregation of criteria (i.e.,
factors),xn, that can have different units, with the objective
of providing an overall score. The CI acts as an aggregation
function deﬁned with respect to fuzzy measures . A fuzzy
measure () is deﬁned as a set function that acts on the domain
of all possible combinations of a criteria set [30]. In other
words, fuzzy measures can be thought of as a function that
8
provides a value to every possible combination of inputs. The
complexity of the set is determined by the 2nsubsets that
compose it, where nis the number of criteria, i.e., the number
of input factors in the aggregation.
Formally, ageneralfuzzy measure isdeﬁned asasetfunc-
tion: 2n![0;1],whereN=fx1;x2;:::;xngrepresents the
setthat contains allcriteria.The functionmust bemono -
tonic (i.e.,(A)(B)when everAB),andmust satisfy
(;) = 0 and(N) = 1 ,where setsAandBcontaincombi-
nations ofcriteria.ConsideringthatABN,(A)repre-
sents thefuzzy measure or‘importance’ ofthegroup/subset
A.Fuzzy measures give weights toallpossiblecombinations
ofcriteria,which offersgreat ﬂexibilitywhen aggregatingdif-
ferenttypes ofcriteriausingtheCIfordecision-makingpro-
cesses.
The initial weights (i.e., fuzzy measures) for the individual
criteria (e.g., (fx1g);(fx2g), etc.) must be assigned by
‘experts’, which are in charge of giving importance to the
respective individual factors. This ‘weighting’ process can be
performed iteratively using a HiTL approach. On the other
hand, the fuzzy measures of the sets that combine multiple
factors (e.g., (fx1;x2g);(fx2;x3g), etc.) are computed us-
ing the interaction index estimated as:
+ 1 =nY
i=1(1 +i);where 1<0 (18)
The interaction index measures the interaction among criteria,
i.e., it can be considered as a measurement of the interaction
between criteria (factors) in the decision-making process. If
 < 0, a correlating relationship between the criteria exists.
If0, no relationship between the factors exists, i.e., they
contribute independently to the score [29].
Using the calculated interaction index ( ), the fuzzy mea-
sures of sets that combine multiple factors are calculated as:
(fx1;x2;:::;xng) =1
nY
i=1(1 +i) 1(19)
Finally, using the calculated fuzzy measures and the values
of the factors x1;x2;:::;xn, the CI can be computed as:
CI=nX
i=1[xi xi 1](Fi) (20)
wherex0= 0 by convention, and Fi=i;:::;n is the subset
of indexes of the n i+ 1largest component. The output of
the CI usually lies in the unit interval [0;1]; however, other
choices can be deﬁned [29]. A simple numerical example of
how to compute and all the fuzzy measures of a set of three
criteria (i.e., three factors) is presented below.
Let us assume that there exist a set of three criteria
x1;x2;x3that we want to combine using the CI. To compute
the CI, we must ﬁrst compute the fuzzy measures using Eq.
(19) and their corresponding using Eq. (18). To do this, fuzzy
measures for the individual inputs xmust be assigned. These
are assigned as ‘expert’ weights (i.e., fuzzy measure values)
given by experts. So, 0= 0,1= 0:42,2= 0:5, and
3= 0:62, where0(f;g),1(fx1g),2(fx2g),
and3(fx3g). Then, using Eq. (18), can be solved foras+ 1 = (1 + 1)(1 +2)(1 +3). For this particular
example,= 0:748. Finally, using the calculated , we
can use Eq. (19) to compute the remaining fuzzy measure
values for all the combinations of the set of criteria. The
corresponding values calculated for the example given are
(fx1;x2g) = 0:75,(fx1;x3g) = 0:82,(fx2;x3g) = 0:86,
and(fx1;x2;x3g) = 1:0. With the fuzzy measure (i.e,
weights) calculated, the CI can be then computed for any input
valuesx1;x2, andx3using Eq. (20).
For our case, the CI is the method used to combine the
different Electrical ,IT, and Graph-theory factors that charac-
terize the current state of a CPES, and thus compute the CPES-
QSM for each node that exists in the CPES. For instance,
the factors used as inputs to the CI that produces the CPES-
QSM for node icould bexi
1=CRPIi,xi
2=QCR -Bi,
xi
3=VDIi,xi
4=SVSIi, andxi
5=VCPIi. Each one
of these factors is given a corresponding ‘importance’ or
‘expert’ weight (fuzzy measure) 1;2;:::; 5. It is important
to note that other papers in the literature, such as [14] and
[13], have also used the CI approach for combining different
factors in the process of computing cyber-physical resilient
analysis metrics, due to the CI characteristics of allowing the
aggregation of non-additive nonlinear criteria without assum-
ing independence of each criterion. More details about the
main differences between our proposed approach and works
in the literature are speciﬁed in Section I.
III. C YBER -CONSTRAINED ACOPF F ORMULATION
This section presents an overview of the proposed cyber-
constrained ACOPF (C-ACOPF) formulation. Subsection
III-A focuses on presenting and discussing the traditional
ACOPF (T-ACOPF) formulation. Subsection III-B presents
the modiﬁcations made to the traditional mathematical for-
mulation of the ACOPF so that it can take into account
both physical and cyber operating factors of the CPES being
optimized; allowing for the consideration of cyber factors in
its decision-making process.
A. Traditional ACOPF Full Formulation
The classical ACOPF formulation can be written as pre-
sented in Eqs. (21) - (30). Eq. (21) is the objective cost
function of the system, Eq. (23) - (25) represent the operational
power constraints, Eq. (26) - (29) represent the branch power
and current constraints, and Eq. (30) represent the voltage
angle difference constraints. There exist other formulations
and extensions such as security-constrained optimal power
ﬂow, DC OPF, and other relaxations [31]–[34]. However, our
proposed C-ACOPF is based on the traditional nonconvex
ACOPF polar formulation presented.

B. Cyber-Constrained ACOPF Formulation
From the formulation presented in the last subsection, it
can be observed how the T-ACOPF formulation essentially
prioritizes minimizing a cost function that only takes into
account the physical states of the system. However, the C-
ACOPF formulation presented in this subsection is intended
to include the cyber-physical perspective of the system. This
perspective is facilitated by using the CPES-QSM, presented in
the previous section, as a proxy for the cyber-physical factors
operating conditions that make up the CPES. The general
formulation in Eq. (21)-(30) can be stated in a simpliﬁed form
as:
minC(x) (31)
s.t.G(x) = 0 (32)
H(x)l (33)
xminxxmax (34)
whereC(x)is the cost function, G(x)are the equality
constraints, and H(x)are the inequality constraints of the
problem. The state variables consist of xfor a particular
generation node k. Note that the metric can also be extended
to controllable load buses. The CPES-QSM is included in the
formulation to bias the optimization solution towards ‘reliable’
generation sources, i.e, the OPF formulation will aim to de-
crease the power injections from buses where the CPES-QSM
value are above a particular threshold. The variable provides
the threshold value for which a bus with a CPES-QSM score
above this threshold is considered ‘unreliable’. In practice, this
value must be determined by expert operators in charge of
managing the system being analyzed and may be different
for different systems. Considering the particular threshold
deﬁned, the CPES-QSM score ( CQk) directly impacts the
upper bounds of the state variables Pg

changes according to the current cyber-physical state of the
system and differs according to different types of attacks,
e.g., data integrity attacks (DIAs), data availability attacks
(DAAs), etc, which directly affect the QCR-A/B factors. The
generation limits inequality condition of Eq. (23) is modiﬁed
with Eqs. (35)–(37), while the other inequality conditions of
the problem remain the same. The binary variable determines
if the generator kmust be disabled or adjusted according
to HiTL preferences, e.g. if a generator is considered fully
compromised and must be disconnected ( = 1) instead of
just curtailed ( = 0).
As seen in the above formulation, deﬁnes the boundaries,
which must be deﬁned by experts operating the system,
between a ‘reliable’ and an ‘unreliable’ generation node. If the
CPES-QSM value (shown here as CQ) is greater than or equal
tothen the node is considered ‘unreliable’ and its generation
is either curtailed to a range of its minimum to maximum
values or completely turned off. On the other hand, if CQ is
lower thanthen the node is considered ‘reliable’ and there
is no change in its maximum dispatch capacity. It is important
to note that the curtailment of the generators can be deﬁned as
a continuous function that curtails generation according to a
speciﬁc percentage value instead of Pgl
k. By constraining the
generation in ‘unreliable’ nodes, the OPF solution provides a
more ‘secure’ solution that relies on the generation of more
reliable nodes at the cost of more expensive generation that
yields a higher traditional cost. The ﬁnal C-ACOPF solution
makes the system more secure in terms of the cyber-physical
security of the CPES while sacriﬁcing generation cost.

IV. E XPERIMENTAL SETUP AND CASE STUDIES
The code used to run the case studies presented in this
section can be found in [35]. The case study presented here
is based on the IEEE RTS-24 test system, which is the
ﬁrst part of the IEEE RTS-96 test system presented in [36].
This system has 10 generators, 1 slack bus (bus #12), 17
loads, and 32 transmission lines. The speciﬁc loads, lines,
and generators capacities/parameters are taken from the case
model ‘case24 ieee rts.m’ available in MATPOWER [37].

For this case study, we assume that every physical node
that exists in the electrical transmission network is mapped
with a cyber node composed of just one IoT device at the
cyber-layer of the CPES. This will greatly simplify the
cybersecurity model of the system for explanation purposes
since only the QCR-B factor will be used to characterize the
vulnerabilities on the node; but, for more complex CPES,
the QCR-A model can be used to model complex attack
graph-based vulnerabilities that exist in multiple IoT devices.
A. Traditional ACOPF Results
In order to evaluate the advantages, in terms of the CPES
security, of using the proposed C-ACOPF formulation, the
solution of the T-ACOPF formulation is used as a baseline.
The T-ACOPF solution is obtained by running the ACOPF
PandaPower solver [38], which uses theprimal-dual interior-
point method implemented usingthePython Interior Point
Solver (PIPS) inthePyPower pack age. Table III shows the
generator dispatch solution for the T-ACOPF formulation. The
total cost for the solution is $49,903.5432. Fig. 6 shows the
bus voltages and line congestion of the solution.
B. Cyber-Constrained ACOPF using CPES-QSM
In order to compute the C-ACOPF solution for the IEEE
RTS-24 test system, we must ﬁrst calculate the CPES-QSM
metric value for each node in the system and ‘adjust’ the
corresponding generation and power ﬂow of ‘unreliable’ nodes
identiﬁed based on the current status of the system. The ﬁrst
step in the process is to select the factors to be considered for
this case study and assign the respective ‘expert’ weights for
each one of these factors. The factors selected for this case
study are: CRPI, QCR-B, VDI, SVSI, and VCPI. The ‘expert’
weights, i.e., fuzzy measure values, assigned to each one of
these factors are: [0:26;0:55;0:61;0:65;0:66], respectively. A
higher value represents higher individual importance of the
factor in the ﬁnal score computation. These weights were
estimated after running multiple test cases and manually evalu-
ating the operating conditions of the test system. Based on the
number of factors used, there are 25= 32 total fuzzy measure
values that go from (;) = 0:0to(fx1;x2;x3;x4;x5g) =
1:0. Some of the intermediate values are (fx1;x2g) = 0:669,
(fx1;x3g) = 0:714, and,(fx1;x4g) = 0:743. Some of
them are not listed due to space limitations, but their calcula-
tion is trivial. The corresponding computed is = 0:983.TABLE IV

Using theand fuzzy measure values estimated, we can
proceed to evaluate the current status of the operating CPES
by calculating the CPES-QSM metric value for each node in
the system. It is important to remark that at this point, the
weights or fuzzy measure values are set and do not need
to be recomputed every time the CPES-QSM metric value
is estimated. Hence, for computing the CPES-QSM metric
for each node, the current operating measurements for each
factor considered are obtained and processed to compute the
corresponding CPES-QSM for that speciﬁc node. For this
case study, an ACPF is run in order to estimate the current
operating measurements for each node, which in turn are used
to compute each factor considered. It is important to note that
in a ‘real’ system, these values are obtained either through IoTs
and/or SE. Table IV presents the calculated CPES-QSM values
for each node in the system according to the corresponding
factors computed. The time execution oftheT-ACOPF is
1.1209 seconds, while thetime execution oftheentireCPES -
QSM value computation and C-ACOPF is1.3647 seconds.
The speciﬁcations ofthemachine inwhich thetests were
performed are: CPU -AMD 4900HS clocked at3.00 GHz
and 16GBRAM. Based onthetests conducted, theentire
CPES -QSM computation and C-ACOPF process seemed to
be0.82x slower, onaverage, than theT-ACOPF process.
As seen in Table IV, and using a = 0:2value (where 
is the limit given by experts that provides the limit difference
between a ‘reliable’ node and an ‘unreliable’ node), there are
a few nodes that can be categorized as ‘unreliable‘. This is
due to the fact that the estimated CPES-QSM value (i.e, CQ)
is higher than the limit given by the = 0:2, and in turn,
some of the factors of these nodes tend to be higher than the

where the CPES-QSM value is estimated after the C-ACOPF

It should be noted that the values in the table were cut to
two signiﬁcant ﬁgures due to space limitations. Results are
normally presented using 5-6 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, so further
minor differences can be observed in some cases. For this case
study, a DAA-type attack, e.g., Denial-of-Service (DoS), is
considered as the threat to the system. The threat model for the
cyberthreat is based on the threat model presented in [1]. This
DAA threat has the capability of exploiting the vulnerabilities
of the affected node(s) making them unresponsive (by delaying
control and measurements) to operating commands. In our
speciﬁc case, all nodes except bus #15 (the affected node)
are considered to have a very ‘secure’ operation based on
the QCR-B factor estimated. These are categorized using
the following parameters fAV: Local, PR: High, AC: High,
UI: Requiredg, while bus #15 is categorized as ‘unreliable’
based onfAV: Network, PR: None, AC: Low, UI: None g
vulnerabilities exploited by the threat. The results obtained
showcase how the cyber factors are taken into consideration
when deciding the optimal AC power ﬂow of a CPES that is
currently under attack from a cyber perspective. Table V shows
the generator dispatch solution for the C-ACOPF formulation.
The total cost for the solution is $53,621.1357.
Fig. 6 shows the bus voltages and line congestion of the C-
ACOPF solution. As seen in the ﬁgure, the OPF solution gets
adjusted to take into account the ‘unreliable’ nature of bus #15
(currently under attack), which in turn derives from the high
cyber and physical factors. The power ﬂows from bus #15 to
bus #13 and from bus #15 to #18 get reduced by 8%, while
the power ﬂows from bus #14 to bus #15 and from bus #16
to bus #15 increase by 7% and 0.45%, respectively. The
corresponding CPES-QSM values of the cyber-constrained
solution are shown in the last column of Table IV. As seen,
theCQ value for node #15 (affected) decreased from 0.21 to
0.16, putting it below the threshold. These results clearly
demonstrate how the C-ACOPF increases the generation from
other more ‘reliable’ sources and takes into account the current
status of not only the physical system but the cyber-system
components; thus, producing results that make the systemTABLE V

more secure and resilient from the cybersecurity point of view.
It is important to note how the CPES-QSM values for nodes
#14 and #23 are still over the threshold; however, these
cannot be directly adjusted based on the ACOPF solution since
their criticality is derived from the CRPI factor, which in turn,
is related to the physical topology of the system. This factor
can be reduced by performing other control operations that
directly change the topology of the system, but these control
operations are not in the scope of this paper. Future work will
focus on exploring other control solutions that can be adjusted
based on the CPES-QSM metric.
C. Effects of Cyberattacks in Traditional ACOPF and Cyber-
Constrained ACOPF Formulations
In this subsection, the effects that a cyberattack may have
in a system, as the one evaluated in the previous subsection,
are explored. The effects are evaluated by comparing the
frequency and voltage effects of the system when a cyberattack
compromises a vulnerable node. For this case study, we use the
dispatch results from the T-ACOPF and the C-ACOPF in order
to examine the different responses these systems would have
when a DAA threat (capable of exploiting the vulnerabilities
of the affected node(s) by making them unresponsive via
the delay of control and measurements) is deployed. More
speciﬁcally, in this case, the cyber threat compromises the
vulnerable generator at the ‘unreliable’ bus identiﬁed by the
C-ACOPF formulation, i.e., generator at bus #15, by making
it inoperable for 5 seconds. The threat model of such an attack

is similar to existing attacks found in the literature [1], [39].
The time-domain simulation of the IEEE RTS-24 test system
used for this analysis is performed using the Power System
Analysis Toolbox (PSAT) [40].
Fig. 7 showcases the differences in the frequency response
for both the T-ACOPF and C-ACOPF solutions when a 5
seconds DAA is used to compromise the IoT(s) connected to
the generator at bus #15. The cyberattack was carried out at
t=30s tot=35s. As seen in the ﬁgure, the frequency variation
of the T-ACOPF solution system is signiﬁcantly higher than
the frequency variation caused by the cyberattack in the C-
ACOPF solution system. The frequency even crosses for an
instance the upper limit (at 60.1 Hz) of the system’s frequency.
Figs. 8 and 9 depict the voltages for all the nodes in the
system for the time period evaluated. As observed in these
ﬁgures, the voltage variations are also much more notable in
the T-ACOPF system when compared to the C-ACOPF system.
In fact, in the C-ACOPF solution system, the cyberattack is
barely noticeable, in terms of voltage values.
These results clearly demonstrate that the use of the pro-
posed C-ACOPF formulation, enhanced by the CPES-QSM,
has major advantages when compared to the T-ACOPF for-
mulation due to the fact that this new formulation and metric
consider not only the physical state of the system but also the
current cyber state in order to improve control and operation
decisions that could make the system more secure and stable.
In this case study, the C-ACOPF correctly cataloged bus #15 as
an ‘unreliable’ node due to its high QCR-B value and limited

its generation output to a minimum. So, when the node got
compromised (attacked by an adversary), the system did not
suffer much and was able to endure any possible subsequent
damage. Since the T-ACOPF solution was not ‘cyber aware’
as the C-ACOPF solution, the system presented a higher
variability when the attack happened and a longer attack (e.g.,
15+ seconds) may have caused more substantial damage. The
loss of 54.30 MW generation is not the same as the loss of
155 MW generation and this is reﬂected in the results.
V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a quantitative cyber-physical security metric
for CPES and a cyber-constrained ACOPF formulation are
proposed to cope with the security challenges of modern
CPES. The CPES-QSM cyber-metric is designed to incorpo-
rate diverse types of critical factors affecting the cybersecurity
and operation of CPES while providing a quantitative value
to the cyber and physical status of the operating CPES. This
cyber-metric is integrated, as a proxy, to transform the tradi-
tional ACOPF formulation into a cyber-constrained ACOPF
formulation designed to produce a more secure operating
point that considers vulnerabilities existing in IoT and OT
devices deployed in the system’s physical and cyber networks.
Experimental case studies, based on a DAA-type of attack and
using the IEEE RTS-24 bus system, are presented to show the
effectiveness of the proposed CPES cyber-metric. The results
of the case study are discussed and evaluated against the
traditional ACOPF formulation, in terms of cost, line loading
percentage, and CPES security.
Based ontests conducted, some ofthefactors considered
when computingtheCPES -QSM may have asignificant im-
pact inthescalabilityoftheproposed method. There fore, fu-
ture work will focusonexploringthescalabilityofthepro-
posed approach byevaluatingitsperformance inlarge -scale

Abstract
This paper examines how Canadian firms balance the benefits of technology adop-
tion against the rising risk of cyber security breaches. We merge data from the 2021
Canadian Survey of Digital Technology and Internet Use and the 2021 Canadian Survey
of Cyber Security and Cybercrime to investigate the trade-off firms face when adopting
digital technologies to enhance productivity and efficiency, balanced against the poten-
tial increase in cyber security risk. The analysis explores the extent of digital technology
adoption, differences across industries, the subsequent impacts on efficiency, and associ-
ated cyber security vulnerabilities. We build aggregate variables, such as the Business
Digital Usage Score and a cyber security incidence variable to quantify each firm’s digital
engagement and cyber security risk. A survey-weight-adjusted Lasso estimator is em-
ployed, and a debiasing method for high-dimensional logit models is introduced to iden-
tify the drivers of technological efficiency and cyber risk. The analysis reveals a digital
divide linked to firm size, industry, and workforce composition. While rapid expansion of
tools such as cloud services or artificial intelligence can raise efficiency, it simultaneously
heightens exposure to cyber threats, particularly among larger enterprises.

1 Introduction
The digital transformation of business operations is reshaping the Canadian economy, offering
opportunities for increased productivity and innovation. For businesses, adopting digital tech-
nologies is no longer optional; it is essential for maintaining competitiveness in a globalized
market. However, with greater reliance on digital tools comes an increased exposure to cyber
security risks. Understanding this trade-off —the efficiency gains from digital adoption versus
the vulnerabilities it introduces is critical for Canadian businesses.
This study examines the extent of digital technology adoption and cyber security prac-
tices among Canadian firms, using a novel dataset that combines information from the 2021
Canadian Survey of Digital Technology and Internet Use (SDTIU) and the 2021 Canadian
Survey of Cyber Security and Cybercrime (CSCSC). To our knowledge, this is the first study
to analyze the most recent version of the CSCSC dataset, offering an opportunity to explore
both digital adoption and cyber security. These surveys provide detailed data on firms’ adop-
tion of advanced technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and enterprise
management systems, as well as the frequency, severity, and impact of cyber security incidents
on business operations.
The primary objective of this paper is to explore the trade-off between digital adoption and
cyber security risk, by examining how technological advancement can enhance productivity
while simultaneously increasing firms’ vulnerability to cyber threats. Specifically, we analyze
which types of firms are adopting digital technologies, how adoption levels vary across indus-
tries, and whether these technologies are increasing cyber security incidents. We also inves-
tigate the firm-specific factors such as size, industry, and employee characteristics that shape
both technological efficiency and the ability to manage cyber security risks. Our methodolog-
ical contributions include introducing the Business Digital Usage Score (BDUS) to quantify
digital adoption, enabling a comparative analysis of firms’ engagement with digital technolo-
gies.
Given the large number of firms and the high dimensionality of mostly qualitative ex-
planatory variables in our dataset, we introduce high-dimensional logit models estimated via
a Lasso-penalized maximum likelihood estimator with survey weights to ensure representa-
tiveness of Canadian firms. We use a debiasing method for inference on the selected model’s
coefficients and establish its asymptotic validity. To assess how closely firms operate to their
technological usage frontier, we apply stochastic frontier analysis. Additionally, we employ k-
means clustering to categorize firms by technological efficiency, facilitating the identification
2
of distinct profiles of digital adoption and efficiency.
The literature on digital technology adoption emphasizes its role in improving firm pro-
ductivity. Larger firms are often better positioned to implement these technologies, benefiting
from economies of scale and greater access to resources (Leung et al., 2008). In contrast,
smaller firms frequently encounter barriers, including high costs of implementation and lim-
ited technical expertise, which can hinder their ability to fully realize the potential benefits
of digital adoption. Ferrari (2012) demonstrates that industry-specific differences in digital
readiness significantly affect adoption rates, while Aghimien et al. (2021) highlight the role
of regional policies in either enabling or constricting firms’ technological advancement. To-
gether, these studies emphasize the structural factors shaping disparities in digital technology
adoption across firms.
In Canada, Bilodeau et al. (2019), using data from the 2017 CSCSC, show the widespread
reliance of Canadian businesses on digital technologies. They report that about 92% of Cana-
dian businesses used one or more digital technologies or services in 2017, with significant
increases in the adoption of websites and social media integration since 2013. In addition,
just over one-fifth of Canadian businesses reported being impacted by cyber security incidents
that affected their operations, with 54% noting that these incidents prevented employees from
carrying out day-to-day work and about 30% experiencing additional repair or recovery costs.
While digital adoption can boost productivity, it also introduces new risks, particularly
related to cyber security. The Geneva Association, a leading international think tank of
the insurance industry, defines cyber risks as breaches in confidentiality, availability, and
data integrity, posing operational threats to firms that increasingly rely on interconnected
digital systems (Eling et al., 2016). Cebula and Young (2010) expand on this definition,
framing cyber risks as disruptions that extend beyond information technology (IT) systems to
affect broader business stability. In Canada, the Toronto Public Library system experienced
significantdisruptionsfollowingacyberattack, whiletheNovaScotiaHealthDepartmentfaced
operational delays and data breaches during a similar event (Bridge and Zoledziowski, 2024;
Bousquet, 2023).
The adoption of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and enterprise
management systems could increase cyber security risks. Blichfeldt and Faullant (2021) high-
light that while these systems can improve productivity, their complexity often introduces
integration challenges that, if poorly managed, can undermine business operations. Addition-
ally, the widespread use of interconnected devices has expanded the potential attack surface
for cybercriminals, requiring firms to invest more heavily in cyber security infrastructure.
3
Remote work adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the reliance on digital
tools but also introduced new risks and challenges. Hackney et al. (2022) find that firms
effectively utilizing digital technologies during the pandemic demonstrated resilience in main-
taining operations under lockdown conditions. However, Aczel et al. (2021) and Kitagawa
et al. (2021) report that the rapid shift to remote work led to heightened employee burnout
and increased risks of phishing attacks, underscoring the broader implications of accelerated
digital adoption.
Cyber insurance is a tool for mitigating cyber security risks. According to the OECD
(OECD, 2017), the cyber insurance market doubled in size between 2015 and 2020, fueled by
firms’ increasing awareness of cyber threats. However, Fitch Ratings (Fitch Ratings, 2021)
highlights that high premiums and restrictive coverage policies hinder adoption, especially
among smaller firms. Globally, cyber security spending is projected to surpass $170 billion by
2026 (Gartner, Inc., 2021).
Despite the growing demand for cyber insurance, firms may strategically underinvest in
cyber security measures due to the unobservable nature of such investments. Ahnert et al.
(2022) argue that firms may prioritize visible innovations over less transparent risk mitigation
strategies, as clients are often unable to directly evaluate cyber security expenditures. This
dynamic creates a paradox in which firms recognize the increasing risks of digital adoption
but fail to allocate sufficient resources to mitigate them effectively.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the datasets used in the study, the
SDTIU and the CSCSC, as well as the construction of the associated scores and variables.
Section 3 outlines the paper’s main contribution and methodological framework: the survey-
weighted debiased logit Lasso method. Section 4 presents the empirical results, discussing the
key determinants of technological efficiency and cyber security vulnerabilities. We conclude
in Section 5 with a discussion of the implications of our findings for Canadian businesses
and policymakers. The appendix is divided into two parts: Appendix A provides additional
technical details on the survey-weighted debiased logit Lasso model, and Appendix B outlines
the questions that comprise the BDUS and the Cyber Security Incidence indicator.
2 Data Description and Variable Construction
The empirical analysis is based on a merged dataset from two Statistics Canada surveys: the
2021 SDTIU and the 2021 CSCSC. These surveys were merged using firm size and industry
4
classifications from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), enabling an
integrated study of digital adoption and cyber security risks among Canadian businesses.1
The SDTIU focuses on digital technology adoption, including metrics such as internet
usage, e-commerceparticipation, andICTadoption, whiletheCSCSCexaminescybersecurity
practices and the impact of cyber incidents on businesses. The merged dataset includes both
qualitative variables, such as the implementation of specific technologies and cyber security
measures, and quantitative variables, such as cyber security expenditure and incident-related
costs. Together, the surveys cover numerous variables relevant to digital adoption and cyber
security. The firms vary in size, ranging from small enterprises with fewer than 10 employees
to large corporations with over 500 employees. The industries covered include manufacturing,
retail, professional services, and information technology.
Both surveys apply stratified sampling by industry and firm size, with survey weights
correctingforselectionprobabilities,non-responses,andsamplingbiases. Theseweightsensure
that the results are representative of the broader population of Canadian enterprises. The
SDTIU achieved a response rate of 73%, while the CSCSC had a response rate of 65%. The
pre-matched weighted samples cover 327,567 enterprises for the SDTIU and 185,644 for the
CSCSC. After merging, the final dataset comprises a weighted sample of 179,657 enterprises,
ensuring comprehensive coverage across various business demographics.
Below, we introduce aggregate measures of digital technology usage: BDUS in Section
2.1, a separate measure of Business Technological Efficiency (based on k-means clustering) in
Section 2.2, which examines whether firms encounter significant challenges in implementing
the technologies they adopt, and an indicator for Cyber Security Incidence in Section 2.3.
2.1 Business Digital Usage Score
The BDUS is a quantitative variable constructed to evaluate the digital engagement of Cana-
dian firms by measuring the technologies they have adopted. It condenses responses from the
2021 SDTIU into a single, interpretable score that reflects the cumulative utilization of digital
tools across ten distinct domains, such as cloud computing, digital payment systems, artifi-
cial intelligence (AI), smart devices, online sales, government digital connectivity, fiber-optic
internet, and company websites (see Appendix B for the exact questions).
1Methodological differences between the surveys include variations in enterprise size definitions (for small
firms: SDTIUdefinessmallfirmsasthosewith5–49employees, whileCSCSCdefinesthemas10–49employees)
and potential differences in primary respondents’ understanding of their enterprise’s operations. Additionally,
the surveys differ in target populations, including NAICS and enterprise size requirements.
5
For each of the ten domains, we create a binary variable equal to 1 if the firm reports using
that technology. Summing these indicators yields a score between 0 and 10, with higher values
indicating more extensive digital engagement. Although it is conceivable that advanced tech-
nologies (e.g., AI) have disproportionate impacts on firm productivity compared to simpler
ones (e.g., a basic website), weighting them by perceived importance would introduce addi-
tional assumptions. Firms also have heterogeneous technological needs, some rely heavily on
cloud computing for scalable data storage, while others benefit more from online payment sys-
tems or data analytics. Therefore uniform summation provides a transparent, easily replicable
index of a firm’s overall digital footprint.

Figure 1: Histogram of Business Digital Usage Scores
Figure 1 shows the distribution of BDUS scores. The majority of firms fall within scores
of 3 to 7, suggesting moderate overall adoption levels, with mild peaks at 4 and 6. At the
extremes, a small proportion of firms report virtually no digital engagement (score = 0),
whereas another small subset achieves near-comprehensive adoption (scores of 9 or 10). This
dispersion highlights the heterogeneity of adoption patterns: some businesses implement only
a handful of relevant technologies, while others adopt a wide array.
It is important to note that the BDUS does not measure the intensity of usage or the ease
of integration. Rather, it provides a concise snapshot of whether certain well-known tools have
been adopted in at least a basic form. We use the BDUS to investigate the characteristics
of firms that adopt digital technologies through a stochastic frontier model in Section 4,
measuring how close businesses are to their technological frontier. Additionally, we use the
BDUS to assess whether having a more extensive digital profile correlates with cyber risk
exposure (Table 1).
6
2.2 Business Technological Efficiency
While the BDUS captures which digital technologies firms adopt, it does not gauge how well
these technologies are integrated. To address this, we construct a measure of Technological
Efficiency by applying a k-means clustering algorithm to a set of SDTIU survey items about
technological implementation challenges. Specifically, these survey items parallel the BDUS
domains but ask whether the firm experiences difficulties using each technology, whereas the
BDUS questions simply ask if firms use each technology. The exact questions used in this
clustering exercise are listed in Appendix B.
Let{zi1,zi2,...,zi10}be binary indicators for firm i, capturing whether it reports a chal-
lenge in each of the ten domains. A response of “Yes” indicates an operational problem in
using the technology associated with that domain. We apply k-means clustering to these
ten binary variables and determine that k= 2is the optimal cluster count, resulting in two
groups:Digitally Efficient andNot Digitally Efficient . Figure 2 displays the percentage of
reported challenges in each domain for these two clusters. Firms in the latter cluster (52,505
businesses) report significantly more issues than those in the former (127,152 businesses). For
example, 70.71% of Not Digitally Efficient firms cite difficulties with AI, compared to 23.58%
in theDigitally Efficient group. Similarly, 57.55% of Not Digitally Efficient firms encounter
challenges with cloud computing, versus only 3.21% among Digitally Efficient firms.
The high incidence of challenges among Not Digitally Efficient firms does not imply that
they fail to adopt these tools. Some businesses report both a high BDUS score (indicating
widespread adoption) and frequent operational issues, suggesting partial or suboptimal imple-
mentation. Even in the Digitally Efficient cluster, a non-trivial share of firms faces difficulties
in at least one domain.
Thisk-means classification yields a binary variable, Technological Efficiency, which we use
as a dependent variable in one of the logit models in Section 4. Whereas the BDUS measures
the extent of adoption, the Technological Efficiency grouping reflects the firm’s ability to use
the technology effectively. In this sense, the two measures are complementary: the BDUS
indicates how many digital tools a firm adopts, while the logit model using the Technological
Efficiency variable reveals whether the adopted technologies are being used efficiently.
2.3 Cyber Security Incidence
To examine the cyber security challenges faced by Canadian businesses, we construct a set of
variables based on survey responses related to the occurrence of cyber security incidents. The

primary variable, Cyber Security Incidence , indicates whether a business was affected by any
cyber security incident in 2021. This binary variable is coded as 1 if the business reported
experiencing one or more types of cyber security incidents, and 0 otherwise. These incidents
range from theft of assets, business data, or intellectual property to disruptions of business
activities. Of the 179,656 surveyed firms, 39,524 (22%) reported at least one such incident,
while the remaining 140,132 (78%) reported none.
Figure 3 shows the occurrence of these incident types among the 39,524 firms that experi-
enced any cyber incident. The most frequently cited issues included incidents to steal money
or demand ransom payment (37%), incidents with an unknown motive (39%), incidents to
steal personal or financial information (33%), incidents to disrupt or deface the business or
web presence (18%), and incidents to access unauthorised or privileged areas (20%). Fewer
respondents reported incidents to steal or manipulate intellectual property or business data
(9.8%) and incidents to monitor and track business activity (9.2%).
We use this binary Cyber Security Incidence variable in subsequent analyses for two pri-
mary reasons. It serves as a dependent variable in the cyber security incidence logit model
(Section 4), where we identify which firm characteristics and digital adoption practices predict
a higher likelihood of experiencing an incident. The Cyber Security Incidence variable is also

included as a regressor in our stochastic frontier analysis to examine whether having experi-
enced a breach correlates with digital technology usage. The rationale is that a prior cyber
incident may influence firms’ subsequent decisions or capabilities regarding digital adoption
and security investments. A full list of cyber incidence types appears in Appendix B.
3 Estimation Methodology: Survey Weighted Debiased
Lasso
To estimate models predicting technological efficiency and cyber security incidents, we employ
a survey-weighted logistic Lasso (hereafter svy LLasso ) estimation technique and introduce
a debiasing method for inference. This approach is well-suited to our analysis, as it effectively
handles high-dimensional data and incorporates a diverse set of variables, including digital
technologyusage, cybersecuritypractices, andfirmcharacteristics. OurprimaryLassomodels
include over 50 independent variables, while second-order interaction models expand to more
than 200 variables.
To accurately represent the population of Canadian businesses, we adapt the standard
logistic Lasso method to incorporate Statistics Canada survey weights. To this end, we define
9
the following general ℓ1-penalized maximum likelihood estimator for a Generalized Linear
Model with survey weights, where the svy LLasso estimator is a special case:
ˆθ= argmin
θ=(α,β′)′∈Rp+1
−Ln(θ) +λp/summationdisplay
j=1|βj|
,
where:
•θ= (α,β′)′includes the intercept αand coefficients β∈Rp,
•Ln(θ) =−n−1/summationtextn
i=1wig(yi,x′
iθ)is the survey-weighted log-likelihood, where g(y,x′θ)is
the negative log-density function (see Appendix A.2 for a detailed description), xiis the
regressor vector for firm i,yiis the outcome variable, and wiis the survey weight,
•λ/summationtextp
j=1|βj|is the penalty term, with tuning parameter λ, enforcing sparsity by shrinking
less relevant coefficients to zero.
For our logit models, this approach selects the variables most predictive of technological effi-
ciency and cyber security incidents while accounting for survey weights. This framework was
adopted by Jasiak and Tuvaandorj (2023) and Jasiak et al. (2024), with the former developing
an inference method different from the one we consider below.
InferenceviaDebiasing. Forstatisticalinferenceonmodelparametersandaveragemarginal
effects (AME) (Appendix A.1), we adapt the debiased Lasso method from Zhang and Zhang
(2014)andJavanmardandMontanari(2014)tothesurveycontextdescribedabove. Giventhe
ℓ1-penalized maximum likelihood estimator ˆθ, the debiasing (DB) method applies a one-step
correction:
˜θ=ˆθ+ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(ˆθ),
where ˆH(ˆθ)andS(ˆθ)arethenegativeHessianandscorefunctionoftheweightedlog-likelihood
functionLn(θ). The adjustment term ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(ˆθ)corrects the bias introduced by the ℓ1-
penalized variable selection, enabling reliable inference. This variant, which uses the standard
Hessian, follows Xia et al. (2023), who consider standard GLMs, adapted here for survey
weights. We estimate the asymptotic variance of n1/2S(θ0)using a sample information matrix
ˆI(ˆθ)(see Appendix A.2), where θ0represents the unknown true values of θ.
For a nonlinear parameter function ρ(θ)(anr×1vector, possibly n-dependent), e.g., the
AME, we define the debiased estimator:
10
˜ρ=ρ(ˆθ) + ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(ˆθ),˙ρ(θ) =∂ρ(θ)′
∂θ. (3.1)
Asymptotic Validity. We establish the asymptotic validity of Wald-type inference in the
following proposition. To keep the exposition simple, the underlying framework, definitions,
and assumptions are provided in Appendix A.

The proof is provided in Appendix A.3. The order of the tuning parameter λis standard
in the literature (Bühlmann and van de Geer, 2011; Negahban et al., 2012; van de Geer et al.,
2014; Hastie et al., 2015). The assumptions on the number of covariates pand model sparsity
m0align with those in Xia et al. (2023). In particular, the condition m0logp/radicalig
p/n→0
is stronger than the condition m0logp√n→0assumed by van de Geer et al. (2014). However,
unlike van de Geer et al. (2014), no direct assumption is imposed on the sparsity of the inverse
Hessian (or information matrix).
The assumption of a locally Lipschitz Jacobian ˙ρ(θ)is slightly stronger than the usual con-
tinuous differentiability condition required for testing nonlinear hypotheses (see, e.g., Newey
and McFadden (1994, Section 9) and Hansen (2022 a,b)). Under this assumption, the estima-
tion error arising from the estimation of θ0andρ(θ0)becomes negligible.
Using this proposition, we make inference on the parameters θ0andρ(θ0). In sum, the
debiasing approach above offers a straightforward and robust way to analyze high-dimensional
survey data, ensuring both variable selection and valid inference in the presence of survey
weights.

4 Empirical Results
The empirical analysis examines the relationship between digital technology adoption and
cyber security vulnerabilities among Canadian businesses. We begin by assessing whether
broader digital adoption correlates with increased cyber risk (Section 4.1) using rank corre-
lations between the BDUS and various security measures. Next, we estimate a Stochastic
Frontier Analysis (SFA) model (Section 4.2), treating the BDUS as an “output” to identify
which factors drive a firm toward its digital usage frontier. We then employ logit models with
Lasso selection for two binary outcomes: Technological Efficiency (Section 4.3) and Cyber
Security Incidence (Section 4.4), allowing us to determine whether the same firm characteris-
tics or digital practices that foster greater adoption also enhance implementation efficiency or
increase cyber vulnerability.
The sample sizes for the analyses are as follows: the svy LLasso results for business ef-
ficiency are based on a weighted sample of 175,428 businesses, excluding those with a BDUS
score less than 2. The cyber security incidence model uses the full merged dataset, encompass-
ing 179,657 businesses. The svy LLasso procedure is implemented using R, where we utilize
the default value of the tuning parameter λfrom the Rpackage glmnet(see Appendix A.1).
4.1 Digital Technology Adoption and Cyber Security
We explore whether a broader digital presence for a firm correlates with heightened cyber risk.
Table 1 reports polychoric and polyserial correlations between the BDUS (an ordinal score
from 0 to 10) that measures the amount of technology a firm has adopted and various cyber
security measures, including firms cyber security spending (continuous variable), a binary
indicator for whether or not a firm experienced a cyber incident, and whether or not a firm
paid ransom as a result of a cyber security breach. We use polychoric correlation for ordinal
to binary comparisons and polyserial correlation for the ordinal to continuous comparison.
The positive and significant correlation between BDUS and both cyber security spending
(ρ= 0.156∗∗∗) and experiencing an incident ( ρ= 0.083∗∗∗) suggests that while digitally en-
gaged firms invest more in security, they also face greater exposure to attacks. Firms with
a higher BDUS are also more likely to have to pay a ransom as a result of a cyber security
breach (ρ= 0.266∗∗∗). The absence of any cyber security measures correlates negatively with
BDUS (ρ=−0.068∗∗∗), indicating that firms with minimal digital footprints may perceive
fewer threats but also forgo basic protective actions.

Notes:The table reports polychoric correlations for ordinal–binary comparisons and polyserial correlations
for the ordinal BDUS and the continuous measure of cyber security spending. All correlations are statistically
significant at the 1% level. Significance levels: *** p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0.10. Sample size: 179,657.
These correlations provide preliminary evidence of a trade-off: as firms adopt more digital
tools (higher BDUS), they may both allocate more resources to cyber security and become
more frequent targets of attacks. This finding motivates the proceeding empirical analyses.
4.2 Digital Technology Adoption by Canadian Businesses
We estimate an SFA model to examine which firm-level and industry-level characteristics
bring businesses closer to their “digital usage frontier.” Treating BDUS (a quantitative score
0–10) as an “output” — that is, the extent to which a firm adopts digital tools — allows us
to separate random variation from systematic shortfalls in adoption. The frontier approach
is particularly useful because some firms may lag in adopting new technologies for reasons
beyond mere chance (e.g., internal constraints or strategic decisions). In this specification, a
positive coefficient indicates that the corresponding variable moves firms closer to the frontier
of digital adoption.
Table 2 presents the maximum likelihood estimates for the logistic SFA model. We use
a logistic specification to account for the bounded nature of BDUS, recognizing that moving
from, for example, two to three adopted technologies represents a more substantial increase
in digital capacity than moving from eight to nine. The explanatory variables are grouped
into three categories: Firm characteristics ,Digital technologies , andCyber security measures .
After controlling for industry fixed effects, the estimated mean efficiency score across all firms
is 77%, suggesting that while most businesses integrate some digital tools, gaps remain.

facturing (0.043∗∗∗) andArts/Accommodation/Food (0.106∗∗∗) both exceed the baseline cate-
gory ofProfessional services .
For cyber security measures, the share of Female employees in ICT roles (0.002∗∗∗) is the
only strongly significant predictor, indicating that a higher percentage of women in ICT corre-
lates with greater digital adoption. The variance parameter estimates confirm that systematic
inefficiency ( σu) dominates random noise ( σv), suggesting that much of the under-adoption of
digital tools is rooted in structural constraints rather than chance.
These results imply that resource capacity (firm size), remote-work arrangements, and the
availabilityofspecificdigitaltoolsormanagerialpractices(e.g., opensource, clientinformation
management) can propel Canadian firms closer to their feasible frontier of technology usage.
Industries such as Construction or Education/Health appear to face adoption barriers, while
manufacturing and consumer-facing sectors integrate digital tools more readily. Although
extensive digital adoption may heighten cyber threats (Section 4.1), most of the cyber security
variables analyzed here do not notably influence how far along a firm is on the adoption curve.
4.3 Technological Efficiency of Canadian Businesses
The SFA analysis, using BDUS as the dependent variable in Section 4.2, measures the extent
of digital adoption but does not capture how effectively these tools are utilized. To address
this distinction, we introduce a binary variable for Technological Efficiency , derived through
k-means clustering. This clustering algorithm categorizes firms based on whether they report
few or many operational difficulties in using adopted technologies. A firm is classified as
“Technologically Efficient” if it experiences relatively few challenges across multiple domains
(see Section 2 for details). We restrict the sample to businesses with BDUS ≥2, ensuring a
baseline level of digital engagement prior to evaluating efficiency.
Table 3 presents the svy LLasso results for the probability of a firm being Technologically
Efficient. The independent variables are grouped into three categories: Firm characteristics ,
Digital technologies , andCyber security measures . A positive coefficient indicates that the

using digital tools efficiently. Medium (]AMEDB= 0.158∗∗∗) andLarge(]AMEDB= 0.102∗∗∗)
firms exhibit higher AME relative to Smallfirms.Remote work (]AMEDB= 0.139∗∗∗) is also
associated withincreasedefficiency. Amongdigital technologies, the IoT(]AMEDB= 0.156∗∗∗)
andBig data analytics (]AMEDB= 0.076∗∗)bothshowstrongpositiveeffects, whileadvertising
efforts, such as free advertising ( ]AMEDB= 0.073∗∗), also correlate with efficient usage. For
industries, Arts/Accommodation/Food (]AMEDB= 0.146∗∗∗) andEducation/Health show a
positive marginal effect ( ]AMEDB= 0.113∗∗∗) compared to Professional services .
Firms endowed with more resources, due to scale (medium or large size) or operational flex-
ibility (remote work) can allocate staff and capital to integrate digital systems more effectively.
Real-time connectivity from IoT and big data appears to reinforce structured work flows, while
advertising activities may align with better-organized digital platforms. Consumer-facing in-
dustries, such as Arts/Accommodation/Food may capitalize on digital marketing tools or
consumer facing technologies such as reservation systems more readily than sectors facing
heavier regulatory or operational barriers.
The variables that reduce the likelihood of efficient digital implementation include Elec-
tronic data interchange (]AMEDB=−0.101∗∗∗) andEnterprise resource planning (]AMEDB=
−0.168∗∗). The AME values suggest that more complex systems can pose challenges with
technological adoption. The Manufacturing industry ( ]AMEDB=−0.065∗∗) has a negative
effect based on AMEs, while certain cyber security variables, such as Employee monitoring
(]AMEDB=−0.184∗∗∗), also correlate negatively with Technological Efficiency.
These negative or insignificant AMEs point to organizational or regulatory factors that can
undermine digital adoption benefits. Complex software solutions (EDI, ERP) often require
robust training and IT resources; without sufficient support, firms may experience integration
hurdles. Industries like Mining/Utilities/Construction may face specialized work flows or
17
regulatorystricturesthatmayobstructrapiddigitalplatformadoption. Certaincybersecurity
practices (employee monitoring) can introduce procedural friction or negative employment
sentiment that overshadows efficiency gains if not carefully managed.
4.4 Cyber Security Incidence
The determinants of Cyber Security Incidence variable are analyzed using a binary dependent
variable introduced in Section 2. The Cyber Security Incidence variable equals 1 if a firm
reported experiencing at least one cyber security incident during 2021, and 0 otherwise; among
179,656 surveyed firms, 32,371 (18.0%) reported an incident. Cyber incidents encompass
a range of adverse events, including theft of business assets, data breaches, disruptions to
business activities, intellectual property losses, and other cyber-related issues. Although a
large number of independent variables are included in the analysis, relatively few emerge as
statistically significant predictors, indicating that cyber risk is shaped by a limited subset of
factors.

Table 4 displays the svy LLasso estimates for the probability of experiencing a cyber
security incident. Among the variables with positive and statistically significant associa-
tions are being a large firm ( ]AMEDB= 0.057∗∗) and adopting confidential cloud solutions
(]AMEDB= 0.067∗∗∗). In addition, certain industry categories Mining/Utilities/Construction,
Manufacturing, Wholesale/Retail/Transport, and Other services exhibit statistically signifi-
cant positive coefficients.
Two factors show negative and statistically significant effects on the likelihood of a cyber
incident. Having over 60% female employees in cyber security roles ( ]AMEDB=−0.056∗)
and holding cyber security insurance ( ]AMEDB=−0.043∗) are both associated with lower
probabilities of experiencing an incident.
These results suggest that larger enterprises may face heightened cyber risks, potentially
reflecting the extensive data infrastructures and more valuable assets characteristic of bigger
firms. Reliance on confidential cloud solutions might increase exposure to attacks, as remote
and cloud-based systems use electronic methods to store data. Lower incidence rates among
firms with higher proportions of female cyber security personnel could indicate that diverse
cyber teams are more adept at preventing or responding to threats. Likewise, the negative
association of cyber security insurance with incidence likelihood hints that insured firms may
adopt more robust preventive strategies to manage their risk profiles.
4.5 Interaction Effects
UsinganadaptiveLassoapproachwithpolynomialexpansions, weinvestigatewhethersecond-
order (interaction) terms enhance the predictive accuracy of our Technological Efficiency and
Cyber Security Incidence specifications. We estimate both a first-order (linear) model and a
second-order model that includes all pairwise interactions among the explanatory variables.
See Bühlmann and van de Geer (2011) for the theoretical background.
Table 5 reports mean-squared cross-validation (CV) errors under each specification, along
with the penalty parameter λcv. For the Technological Efficiency model, allowing second-
order terms substantially lowers the CV error, suggesting that interactions play an important
role in explaining efficiency gains from digital technologies. In the Cyber Security Incidence
model, the simpler first-order specification yields a slightly lower CV error, indicating that
20
higher-order interactions do not improve predictions of cyber security incidence likelihood.
A second-order polynomial specification is justified for the Technological Efficiency model,
therefore we re-estimate the svy LLasso model with interaction terms involving firm size,
remote work, key technologies, and industry classifications. Table 6 shows the significant
interaction terms selected by the svy LLasso estimator, along with their debiased parameter
estimates ˜θDBandp-values. Only the interaction coefficients that were selected by the Lasso
and statistically significant at the 5% level are included in Table 6.

Notes:The table shows the mean-squared CV error from an adaptive Lasso specification with polynomial
expansions of different degrees (1 = linear, 2 = second-order interactions). For each model, λcvdenotes the
penalty parameter that minimizes the CV error. Based on these metrics, the second-order polynomial is
preferred for the Technological Efficiency model, while a first-order specification is preferred for the Cyber
Security Incidence model. Sample size: 179,657.

Medium-sized firms benefit from adopting IoT solutions and online platforms, likely due to
greater resource availability compared to smaller firms. Remote work enhances the efficiency

sectors. Conversely, interactions like online sales with wholesale, retail, and transport are
negatively associated with firm technological efficiency.

5 Conclusion
This paper contributes new evidence on how Canadian businesses navigate the trade-off be-
tween digital technology adoption and heightened cyber security risk. Using data from Statis-
tics Canada’s SDTIU and CSCSC surveys, we construct a BDUS to gauge overall adoption
levels and then evaluate how effectively businesses use these tools by modeling their technolog-
ical efficiency. In addition, we employ a survey-weight-adjusted Lasso estimator and introduce
a debiasing method for high-dimensional logit models to identify the drivers of technological
efficiency and cybersecurity risk.
The stochastic frontier analysis suggests that larger firms, remote work arrangements, and
specific advanced technologies (e.g., open-source solutions, client information management
systems) can push a firm closer to its digital “frontier.” At the same time, a portion of
businesses lag behind feasible adoption levels, as indicated by the high ratio of inefficiency to
noise in the frontier estimations.
Firmsmustbalanceefficiencygainsagainstgrowingcybervulnerabilities. Firmsthatadopt
more sophisticated digital technologies or store sensitive data in the cloud often face elevated
risk exposure. Our svy LLasso model on cyber incidence confirm that large firms and those
using cloud-based services are more likely to report cyber security incidents. However, the pre-
dictive power of cyber risk does not improve with second-order interaction effects, suggesting
that firm size and core technological choices are the primary drivers of cyber exposure. The
two main variables that decreased the likelihood of cyber incidents were firms having cyber
security insurance and firms that had a high representation of females in cyber security roles.
When it comes to technological efficiency simple linear relationships fail to capture the
complexity of how organizational choices, workforce composition, and industry shape digital
outcomes. By allowing second-order (interaction) terms, the svy LLasso approach shows that
certain combinations of variables such as medium firms adopting IoT, or female ICT repre-
sentation interacting with advanced tools like AI can be particularly conducive to efficiency
improvements. On the other hand, friction in implementing complex software like EDI or
ERP can negate some of these benefits.
The analysis demonstrates the importance of firm size and industry. While small firms
are sometimes more “locally efficient,” the resource advantages of larger organizations may
facilitate deeper or more comprehensive integration of technologies. Industries also differ sub-
stantially. In resource- and asset-intensive sectors such as Mining or Construction, strong
positive interactions emerge between targeted digital solutions and improved operational pro-
24
cesses, whereas compliance-heavy fields like Education and Health exhibit more negative or
complex relationships.
Gender composition in ICT roles has meaningful consequences for digital adoption out-
comes. Although our results do not prove a causal mechanism, the recurring positive coeffi-
cients on interactions involving a share of female ICT staff and advanced technologies suggest
that even partial gender diversity in technical teams can amplify the returns to adopting new
tools. This pattern is also seen in broader research suggesting that heterogeneity in skill sets
and perspectives can catalyze creative problem-solving.
The results highlight the balance firms must strike between achieving efficiency gains from
digital technologies and managing increased cyber risks. Larger, digitally advanced firms ap-
proach their efficiency frontier yet face elevated cyber vulnerability, especially when security
practices fall short. Remote work arrangements enhance both digital adoption and techno-
logical efficiency without increasing cyber risk exposure. Female representation in ICT and
cyber security roles consistently improves outcomes across adoption, efficiency, and cyber se-
curity. Certain cyber security practices, particularly obtaining cyber security insurance and
ensuring gender diversity within cyber security roles significantly reduce incident likelihood.
Reliance on cloud-based services, notably confidential cloud storage, emerges as a risk factor
increasing cyber vulnerability. These results suggest policymakers should implement targeted
digital strategies tailored by industry and firm size to boost technological efficiency, while
simultaneously establishing baseline cyber security practices such as insurance coverage and
workforce diversity to mitigate cyber threats effectively.

Tuning Parameter Selection. In the empirical analysis and the small Monte Carlo simu-
lations below, the logit Lasso model svyLLasso is fitted using the Rpackage glmnet. For the
tuning parameter λ, we use the package’s default value, determined by 10-fold cross-validation
with the loss function auc(area under the ROC curve).
Average marginal effect in the logit model. We report the marginal effects (ME) for
each variable along with the coefficient estimates for logit models in the tables. Let Λ(z) =
exp(z)/(1 + exp(z))be the logistic distribution function. For a dummy regressor ˜xij, where
j= 1,...,pandi= 1,...,n, the ME is defined as:
MEij(θ)≡Λ(x′
iθ)|˜xij=1−Λ(x′
iθ)|˜xij=0.
Given the survey weights {wi}n
i=1corresponding to the observations {(yi,x′

whereθ0is the true parameter value, and the expectation is with respect to the regressors’

A.2 Post-Selection Inference for Survey-GLM

(which includes a constant) specified as
f(yi|xi,θ0) = exp(yix′

whereθ0is the true value of the parameter vector θ∈Rp+1, anda(·)andc(·)are known
functions. The combined SDTIU and CSCSC data were collected using a stratified sampling
scheme, wherein units within each stratum are sampled independently with equal probability.
In line with this, we treat wias fixed (see Wooldridge, 2001), and assume {(yi,x′

i=1to be
independent.
Letg(y,x′θ)≡−logf(y,x′θ)and define the weighted log-likelihood function as:

Moreover, we define H(θ0)≡E[ˆH(θ0)]andI(θ0)≡E[ˆI(θ0)].
We will using the following notations in the assumptions and the proof of Proposition 3.1
below. Let λmin(A)andλmax(A)denote the smallest and the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric
matrixA, respectively. For a real matrix A= (aij), let∥A∥∞≡maxi,j|aij|, and∥A∥=/radicalig
tr(A′A)and∥A∥2=/radicalig
λmax(A′A)denote its Frobenius and spectral norms, respectively. The
sub-Gaussian norm of a random variable Xis defined as∥X∥ψ2≡supm≥1m−1/2(E[|X|m])1/m.
The sub-Gaussian norm for the random vector is defined as ∥X∥ψ2≡sup∥b∥=1∥X′b∥ψ2.
We establish the asymptotic validity of the debiasing method under the following assump-
tions imposed directly on the negative log-density function g(y,t)which are similar to the
assumptions employed in van de Geer et al. (2014) and Xia et al. (2023). Let X= [x1,...,xn]′.

ples of size n= 200andn= 400, respectively. Observation weights are wi= 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,

We assess the empirical size of the tests by separately testing two null hypotheses:
H0:θ(2)= 1, H 0: AME 2= 0.11. (A.10)
The empirical sizes of the DB test and the standard survey t-test (tsvy) at the 5% nominal
level are presented in the table below. The standard survey logit tsvytest overrejects by a wide
margin, while the DB test exhibits reasonably accurate null rejection rates for both hypotheses
in most cases, confirming its robustness to regressor dimensionality.

A.3 Proof of Proposition 3.1
We first prove the following lemma, which establishes the asymptotic distribution of a studen-
tized quantity involving the expected Hessian and information matrices, as well as the score
function, all evaluated at the true parameters.

conditions of the multivariate Lindeberg-Feller CLT (see e.g. Theorem 9.3 of Hansen (2022 b)).
First note that E[Xni] = 0because E[si(θ0)|xi] =−E[xiwi(yi−˙a(x′

This verifies (A.11) and the result follows.
Proof of Proposition 3.1 By the mean value expansion,
S(θ0) =S(ˆθ) +ˆH(θ∗)(ˆθ−θ0) =S(ˆθ) +ˆH(ˆθ)(ˆθ−θ0) +R, (A.13)
whereθ∗is the mean-value between ˆθandθ0, andR= [R1,...,Rp+1]′with

i=1(¨g(yi,x′

Note that since ˙ρ(θ)is locally Lipschitz in a neighborhood of θ0, with probability approaching
1∥˙ρ(¯θ)−˙ρ(ˆθ)∥≤B0∥¯θ−ˆθ∥for someB0=O(1). Also, since
n1/2(ρ(ˆθ)−ρ(θ0)) = ˙ρ(¯θ)′n1/2(ˆθ−θ0), (A.15)
where ¯θis a mean-value between ˆθandθ0, we have
n1/2∥˙ρ(ˆθ)−˙ρ(¯θ)∥∥ˆθ−θ0∥=n1/2B0∥ˆθ−¯θ∥∥ˆθ−θ0∥=Op(n1/2m0λ2)
=op(1), (A.16)
where the last line is by n1/2m0λ2=n−1/2m0C2logp≤C2m0(p/n)1/2logp=o(1). Then,
n1/2(˜ρ−ρ(θ0))
=n1/2(ρ(ˆθ)−ρ(θ0)) + ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1n1/2S(ˆθ)
34
=n1/2˙ρ(¯θ)′(ˆθ−θ0) +n1/2˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0)−n1/2˙ρ(ˆθ)′(ˆθ−θ0)−n1/2˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1R
=n1/2˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0)−n1/2˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1R+op(1),
where the first equality is by the definition of ˜ρ, the second equality is by (A.13) and (A.15),
and the third is by (A.16). Below, the proof will be completed in three steps: the first two
steps establish
˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1ˆI(ˆθ)ˆH(ˆθ)−1˙ρ(ˆθ)−˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1˙ρ(θ0) =op(1),
n1/2˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1S(θ0)−n1/2˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1S(θ0) =op(1), (A.17)
and the third step verifies n1/2˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1R=op(1). It will then follow that

Finally, applying Lemma A.1 of and Slutsky’s lemma give the desired result.
Step 1: ˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1ˆI(ˆθ)ˆH(ˆθ)−1˙ρ(ˆθ)−˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1˙ρ(θ0) =op(1).
First, by the triangle inequality
∥˙ρ(ˆθ)′ˆH(ˆθ)−1ˆI(ˆθ)ˆH(ˆθ)−1˙ρ(ˆθ)−˙ρ(θ0)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1˙ρ(θ0)∥2

+∥( ˙ρ(ˆθ)−˙ρ(θ0))′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1˙ρ(θ0)∥2. (A.18)
Consider the first term on the right-hand side of (A.18). By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
∥˙ρ(ˆθ)′/bracketleftigˆH(ˆθ)−1ˆI(ˆθ)ˆH(ˆθ)−1−H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1/bracketrightig

After rearranging and using the triangle and Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities
∥ˆH(ˆθ)−1ˆI(ˆθ)ˆH(ˆθ)−1−H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1∥2
35
=∥(ˆH(ˆθ)−1−H(θ0)−1)ˆI(ˆθ)ˆH(ˆθ)−1+H(θ0)−1(ˆI(ˆθ)ˆH(ˆθ)−1−I(θ0)H(θ0)−1)∥2,

where the last line is by Lemma A.2 of Jasiak and Tuvaandorj (2023) and the CMT. From

By the triangle inequality and (A.23)
∥˙ρ(ˆθ)∥2≤∥˙ρ(ˆθ)−˙ρ(θ0)∥2+∥˙ρ(θ0)∥2=Op(1). (A.24)
Therefore, the quantity in (A.19) is op(1). Consider the second term on the right-hand side of
(A.18). By the triangle inequality and (A.23),
∥˙ρ(ˆθ)′H(θ0)−1I(θ0)H(θ0)−1( ˙ρ(ˆθ)−˙ρ(θ0))∥2

Similarly, for the third term on the right-hand side of (A.18)

B Survey Questions Used for Variable Construction
This appendix provides the survey questions used to construct the Cyber Score, the k-means
clustering variables, and the Business Digital Usage Score (BDUS). Each set of questions
corresponds to specific aspects of digital technology adoption and cyber security challenges.
B.1 Cyber Security Incidence Variable Construction
The Cyber Security Incidence variable is equal to 1 if a firm answers “Yes” to one of the
following questions and 0 otherwise.
To the best of your knowledge, which cyber security incidents impacted your busi-
ness in 2021? Select all that apply.
•Incidents to disrupt or deface the business or web presence.
•Incidents to steal personal or financial information.
•Incidents to steal money or demand ransom payment.
•Incidents to steal or manipulate intellectual property or business data.
•Incidents to access unauthorised or privileged areas.
•Incidents to monitor and track business activity.
•Incidents with an unknown motive.
B.2 Questions Used for k-means Clustering
Thek-meansclusteringvariableswerederivedfromresponsestothefollowingsurveyquestions,
which identify challenges businesses face in utilizing various digital and financial technologies.
Each affirmative response indicates an inefficiency or challenge:
39
•Does your business face challenges with online transaction processing?
•Does your business face challenges with digital marketing?
•Does your business face challenges with data analytics?
•Does your business face challenges with integrating digital technologies into business
operations?
•Does your business face challenges with big data?
•Does your business face challenges with artificial intelligence?
•Does your business face challenges with cloud computing?
•Does your business face challenges with ICT infrastructure?
•Does your business face challenges with government connectivity?
•Does your business face challenges with website operations?
B.3 Questions Used for Business Digital Usage Score (BDUS)
The BDUS is based on responses to questions about the adoption of specific digital technolo-
gies. A “Yes” response to any of the following indicates that the business has utilized the
respective technology:
•Does your business use online transaction processing systems?
•Does your business use digital marketing platforms?
•Does your business use data analytics tools?
•Does your business integrate digital technologies into business operations?
•Does your business utilize big data technologies?
•Does your business employ artificial intelligence tools?
•Does your business use cloud computing services?
•Does your business maintain ICT infrastructure?
40
•Does your business interact with government systems digitally?
•Does your business operate its own website?
The BDUS score is computed as the total number of “Yes” responses to these questions, with
higher scores indicating greater digital engagement.
